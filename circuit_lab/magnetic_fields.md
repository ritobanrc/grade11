1. Magnet -- North and south pole,
    - Earth's magnetic field
    - iron fillings https://youtu.be/Xy6H0mr3KXw?t=62
2. Oersted's experiment
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yawV5ekyN0&t=373s
    - X vs. dot (into vs out of the page)
    - Right hand corkscrew rule
    - Notice: 
        * Nothing like any other forces we've seen
        * Magnetic field appear's to be perpendicular to the current
        * This _only_ exists when there's a current -- reversing the current reverses the magnetic field
3. F_b = q(v x B)
    - Explain cross product (right hand rule) 
    - Notice the directionality of the equation
4. Bubble bath/Gas chamber anti-matter demo
    - Predict what will happen -- uniform magnetic field
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IbyxwaItcQ
5. CRT television (aka Thomson's experiment)
    - Sketch out the model, describe what happens

6. Cyclotron (like large hadron collider)
7. Jumping wire
    - F = i(L x B)
    - https://youtu.be/oopaFtQrW5Y?t=105
7. Current Loop
    - **A motor**
    - https://youtu.be/WI0pGk0MMhg?t=130
    - a commutator and brushes

8. Ampere's Law -- Solenoid
    - Magnetic field through a current loop
    - Statement of ampere's law
    - Magnetic field through a solenoid

9. Faraday's Law and Motional EMFs
    - EMF = -dFlux/dt
    - What is flux?
    - What is EMF?
    - What's up with the negative sign? -- Lenz law
    - Lets do some examples from Griffth's

10. Philosophy
    - Maxwell's Equations
    - Why do KCL and KVL work?
    - Lumped Circuit Abstraction
