# How to Say Nothing In 500 Words by Paul McHenry Roberts

Discussion Questions:

1. What is the author's argument? 

    a. Robert's argues that there are several common errors that students make when writing essays, and demonstrates why they should be avoided.
2. How does he support the argument?

    a. He supports this argument, first by giving an example of a student who writes a paper on college footballs, making all of the mistakes, and illustrating how those were a product of the student's procrastination. Then, he continues to provide examples in his essay illustrating his points.  

3. What are 8-9 of his points about good writing? 
    1. Phrases like "in my opinion" and "it seems to me" are useless and only serve to dilute your point.
    2. It is better to take the less obvious position when writing an essay, simply because it will provide a more interesting subject matter. Additionally, the arguments you use to defend your position should be similarly unconventional, to keep your grader interested.
    3. Overly general statements are useless. Getting to specific examples will almost always allow you to paint a more vivid picture and lead to a better paper.
    4. Padding should be removed, and sentences should be made concise to make them more impactful. 
    5. Similarly, including filler phrases and euphemisms to avoid taking full responsibility for what is being implied, perhaps because its socially taboo, almost always makes your paper less interesting, more roundabout, and less punchy.
    6. Avoiding overused expressions and idioms helps improve your paper, like "at the end of the day" or "when all is said and done".
    7. Colorful words that paint a more vivid picture should be used. In contrast, colorless words, like "nice", which have barely any specific connotation should be avoided.
    8. Colored words, that convey a specific connotation, usually a disparaging one, should be used sparingly, only when your aware of your intention, because most readers will see through it.
