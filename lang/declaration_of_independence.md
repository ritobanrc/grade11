* Preamble
* Indictment of King George III
* Denunciation of the British People
* Conclusion

### Introduction
> The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

* Generalities -- all of human history, "the Course of human events"
    - Setting up grandiosity
    - Nothing specific to the US
    - 3rd person, "one people", "another", "opinions of mankind", "they should", "impel them"
* "necessary" -- it's very stoic, inevitable, natural
    - "determined, existing, or happening by natural laws or predestination; inevitable.""
* Periodic Sentence
    - But the thing at the end is just "declare the causes", they're not asking for permission or even arguing for it, they're just doing the "decent" and respectful thing, just telling him
    - It's just informative
* Tone: Respectful, with Gravitas, Eloquent, Grandiose
* Philosophy: references to "powers of the earth", "Laws of Nature", "Nature's God"
* Short, really 1 sentence

### Preamble

**The Truth**:

1. All men are created equal
2. They have unalienable rights (given by their Creator) -- specifically Life, Liberty, Pursuit of Happiness (very similar to Locke, except Property replaced with Happiness)
3. The purpose of government is to secure rights. 

**The Rights**:
* Life, Liberty, Pursuit of Happiness
* Right to alter/abolish government that doesn't protect rights

Corresponding to the truths

**5 Propositions**:
1. All men have certain unalienable rights
2. The purpose of governments is to secure these rights
3. If the government fails to fulfill its purpose, the people have the right to abolish it
4. Governments should not be changed for minor issues, because revolution is messy
5. But if a sequence of multiple issues arises, where the government opposes its purpose (of protecting rights) in each one, the people should utilize their right to abolish the government. 

**Structural Unity**

It starts by defining "Rights". 
Then it talks about securing "these Rights", transitioning into Government.
Then it talks about the Right to abolish government

By repeating these two ideas, it creates a coherent argument about abolishing government. 
It then presents the best counter-argument, that it shouldn't be changed for "light and transient causes" because that creates more suffering. 

Finally, it shows why that counterargument isn't true. 

**Archetypes** -- Biblical Archetypes

I feel like there's something Biblical going on here. Is it Genesis?
You have the Creation, The Fall of Man, i don't actually know what happens after that


* Creation of mankind
* institution of government
* throwing off of government when it fails
* creation of a new govt that will better secure happiness/safety of mankind

**Tone**:
Its grandiose, overarching, **stately, dignified**, universal
"Governments are instituted among men". For example, phrasing it as "Prudence will dictate" instead of "It's responsible". 

"Endowed by their creator", "right", "duty", its bigger than themselves, it's very philosophical

**Self Evident**:
"these truths" are "self-evident"

Self-evident means something is just true at the face of it, "Requiring no proof or explanation", Synonyms: patently true (doesn't feel as smooth), axiomatic (that just sounds pretentious), MW says "prima facie" is a synonym, but that means "at first glance" which isn't really the same. 

Self evident combines the stately and dignified tone they're going for, with the almost matter-of-fact way they're presenting the case (like, "we're just letting you know, that we're leaving") -- it isn't argumentative, it's just "this is true". 

**Were all government's created to protect rights at the time?**

Nope. Governments at the time were instituted to protect the monarchy, the aristocracy, and maybe the landed gentry. Basically, to protect property and wealth. 

But by presenting it as "this is the purpose of the government", it makes you feel bad, even feel dirty that your government doesn't hold up to this standard. 

Logos: It functions as a premise necessary for the 3rd proposition.


## “Preamble” of the Declaration of Independence
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to
secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving
their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any
Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right
of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government,
laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in
such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and
Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long
established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and
accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed
to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by
abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long
train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object
evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their
right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new
Guards for their future security.
