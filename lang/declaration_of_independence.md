### Introduction
> The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

* Generalities -- all of human history, "the Course of human events"
    - Setting up grandiosity
    - Nothing specific to the US
    - 3rd person, "one people", "another", "opinions of mankind", "they should", "impel them"
* "necessary" -- it's very stoic, inevitable, natural
    - "determined, existing, or happening by natural laws or predestination; inevitable.""
* Periodic Sentence
    - But the thing at the end is just "declare the causes", they're not asking for permission or even arguing for it, they're just doing the "decent" and respectful thing, just telling him
    - It's just informative
* Tone: Respectful, with Gravitas, Eloquent, Grandiose
* Philosophy: references to "powers of the earth", "Laws of Nature", "Nature's God"
* Short, really 1 sentence
