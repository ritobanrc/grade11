# Grapes of Wrath Mimic

## Original
There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificates—died of malnutrition—because the food must rot, must be forced to rot.

The people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river, and the guards hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the kerosene is sprayed. And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quicklime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.

## Rhetorical Analysis
* Anaphora
    - Steinbeck repeats "There is" at the beginning of each sentence when describing the iniquity he sees. This emphasizes the magnitude of each one, really lets the gravitas of what he's saying seep in. It's a "sorrow that weeping cannot symbolize"
* Descriptions
    - "The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit." Steinbeck spends an entire sentence (technically a fragment), just setting the scene, describing what's going on. Then, he subverts all these serene descriptions with "And children dying of pellagra" to draw a contrast between the natural beauty of the land and the man-made harms being caused by profit
* Repetition: 
    - The phrase "the food must rot, must be forced to rot" is extremely redundant. It mentions "rot" twice, "must" and "forced" mean basically the same thing, but he includes it 3 times, just to emphasize how awful it has, and that it's a constructed issue. 
* Parallelism/Anaphora
    - Near the end, he repeats "In the [blank] of the [blank]" at the start of several clauses, first "In the eyes of the people", then "in the eyes of the hungry", and "In the souls of the people", and through each one, he slowly builds up the "the grapes of wrath", the titular metaphor. It starts with "there is the failure", and then increases to "there is a growing wrath", and finally, it finishes with "the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy".

## Mimic
Inspired by Mathematician Paul Lockhart's amazing short story, ["A Mathematician's Lament"](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf).

There is an iniquity here that is beyond expression. There is an evil here that lamentations cannot ease. There is a disappointment so offensive that it renders all our achievements meaningless. A beautiful problem, the crafty proof, the ingenuity, the intuition, the elegant and surprising results. And children struggling through the curriculum must fail because the standards must be met. And the teachers must grade the tests--failed to mention the reflexive property of congruence--because tests must be taken, grades must be submitted.

The students come with brains to learn and experiment, and the curriculum holds them back; they come with pencils and notebooks ready to think and to be challenged, but the intuition is removed. And they seat in their seats and smile and nod and watch the teacher read out a proof of the textbook, dutifully copy down "f is continuous at c if the limit as x approaches c equals f(c)", watch centuries of math, of puzzles, of intrigue decimated and reduced to "1-35 odd"; and in the minds of the students, there is a growing ennui. In the minds of the curious there is a cry for knowledge. In the souls of the inquisitive, the fountain of knowledge is growing dry and parched, the dessicated remains grieving for what could be.
