**Joyas Voladeras**: "Flying Jewels"

### Ethos
* "character", credibility the speaker/author
* Use "The author establishes his/her ethos through..."
     - What are they doing to establish that credibility?

### Pathos
* Using emotions or values through stories
* "Pulling on your heartstrings"
* If overused, can undermine your ethos

### Logos
Based in logic, facts, statistics, and reasoning

### Aristotle's Rhetorical Triangle
The idea that an argument needs all 3 components (ethos, pathos, and logos) in roughly equal parts to create a "triangle"

### Rhetorical Situation
* A Rhetorical Event 
* Background knowledge on the issue
* Where one person is trying to convince an audience

> The rhetorical situation is the circumstance of an event that **consists of an issue, an audience, and a set of constraints**.

### Explicit
The thesis is stated outright

### Implied
The thesis is not stated outright, and must be inferred by the audience

### Inductive Reasoning
* An argument which takes several specific pieces of information and builds a more general conclusion. Premises provide _some_ evidence for the conclusion, but do not guarantee the conclusion. 
* First lay out key facts, then tie them together at the end.
* You build to your thesis

### Deductive Reasoning
Start with general statements, arrives at a specific conclusion that's guaranteed to be true. 

## Schemes
Syntax: the way you construct your sentences, and the impact of those

**Polysyndeton**: _Repeated conjunctions for effect_ (FANBOYS: for, and, not, but, or, yet, so)

    - Can both increase the seriousness, or undercut it, making it more casual

**Asyndeton**: Without the conjunctions (just use commas)

**Juxtaposition**: Putting two distinct things next to each other for effect

**Anaphora**: Repetition of identical words or phrases at the beginning sentences or phrases


## Tropes
Word choice (diction), figurative language

**Simile**: comparison using like or as

**Metaphor**: is a figure of speech that makes an implicit, implied, or hidden comparison between two things that are unrelated, but which share some common characteristics. In other words, a resemblance of two contradictory or different objects is made based on a single or some common characteristics.

**Personification**: Fundamentally, personification is a specific type of metaphor. Generally, personification is defined as a literary device that assigns human qualities and attributes to objects or other non-human things. Simple examples that illustrate this definition can be found easily in our everyday speech.

**Hyperbole**: derived from a Greek word meaning “over-casting,” is a figure of speech that involves an exaggeration of ideas for the sake of emphasis. It is a device that we employ in our day-to-day speech. ... Therefore, a hyperbole is an unreal exaggeration to emphasize the real situation.
