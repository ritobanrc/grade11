> O sinner! Consider the fearful danger you are in: it is a great furnace of wrath, a wide and bottomless pit, full of the fire of wrath, that you are held over in the hand of that God, whose wrath is provoked and incensed as much against you, as against many of the damned in hell. You hang by a slender thread, with the flames of divine wrath flashing about it, and ready every moment to singe it, and burn it asunder; and you have no interest in any Mediator, and nothing to lay hold of to save yourself, nothing to keep off the flames of wrath, nothing of your own, nothing that you ever have done, nothing that you can do, to induce God to spare you one moment. 

I really like the imagery in this section, I think it's extremely vivid. "Great furnace of wrath", "wide and bottomless pit", it might be my favorite description of hell, even more than Dante's Inferno just because I can just imagine the "pit, full of the fire of wrath", and I think he does a really good job weaving both the religious messaging and the imagery, like in "whose wrath is provoked and incensed".
