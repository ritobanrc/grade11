# Original

> And now you have an extraordinary opportunity, a day wherein Christ has thrown the door of mercy wide open, and stands in the door calling and crying with a loud voice to poor sinners; a day wherein many are flocking to him, and pressing into the kingdom of God. Many are daily coming from the east, west, north, and south; many that were very lately in the same miserable condition that you are in, are now in a happy state, with their hearts filled with love to him who has loved them, and washed them from their sins in his own blood, and rejoicing in hope of the glory of God. How awful is it to be left behind at such a day! To see so many others feasting, while you are pining and perishing! To see so many rejoicing and singing for joy of heart, while you have cause to mourn for sorrow of heart, and howl for vexation of spirit! How can you rest one moment in such a condition?

## Analysis
- "And now you have an extraordinary opportunity" sounds like a sales pitch
- "thrown the door of mercy wide open" -- door of mercy, metaphor describing the thing being sold
    - Also "thrown" and "wide open" evoke imagery making the passage feel more dynamic, contrasting with the previous "doom and gloom" feel
- "calling and crying" -- parallelism, using the participle form for emphasis
- "poor sinners" -- loaded language, poor makes them feel bad
- "flocking to him, and pressing into the kingdom" -- parallelism, "flocking" and "pressing"
- "Many are daily coming from the east, west, north, and south;" -- bandwagon fallacy

Lots of loaded language
    - "same miserable condition that you are in" -- more loaded language
    - "now in a happy state"
    - "hearts filled with love" 
    - "pining and perishing!" -- parallelism again, participle form
    - "rejoicing and singing" -- parallelism
    - "mourn for sorrow of heart"

# Mimic

A bit of context for the less nerdy:

- AMD and NVIDIA are two rival GPU (a critical piece of hardware in any gaming computer) manufacture,
- People are very opinionated about which is better. While it is likely true that NVIDIA's performance is superior, AMD offers more flexibility and a more well-rounded prodct, especially for non-gaming usecases. And also, you don't need facts on your side when making a religious speech.
- NVIDIA refuses to open-source their drivers, which makes the extremely difficult to use on Linux (an operating system, largely used by programmers), leading many people extremely frustrated.


And now, you have an extraordinary opportunity, to join AMD and improve your gaming performance tenfold, and buying a new GPU will lead to crisper and cleaner gameplay with a higher FPS; when many are switching to AMD, and partaking in the glory of open-source drivers. Many are daily buying, from avid gamers, hobbyists, streamers, and enthusiasts; many that were very lately crying under the grip of NVIDIA, are now rejoicing in the light of AMD, with their computer cases glowing with LEDs, with colors of blue and green, yellow and purple, now rejoicing in the freedom to use whatever operating system they wish. How awful to be using NVIDIA on such a day! To see so many others reveling, while you are waiting and wallowing! To see so many gaming on Linux and relaxing, while you have cause to use computers that act like its the '90s, and despair for the lack of customization! How can you rest one moment in such a condition?
