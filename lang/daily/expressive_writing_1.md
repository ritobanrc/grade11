# Expressive Writing 1

I'm kinda pissed at myself about yesterday. I'm self taught in programming, and as a result of that, I suffer from two contradictory curses. On one hand, when I'm learning on my own, I have no expectations for the resources that I use to teach myself -- they're free, after all. On the other hand, when I do pay for something, or even learn something in an organized way, I subconsciously expect it to be _better_ than the free resources. Of course, the problem is that I've spent years sifting the wheat from the chaff in those free resources, while most of the time, the organized programming courses I take are kinda crap. As a result, I've spent a disproportionate amount of time ranting about how poorly CS is taught most of the time. 

Now yesterday, we had our first meeting of STEMDev. Maybe you can already see where this is going. Nowhere good. Now for the past several years, 

The meeting started out great, we had some fun, we introduced ourselves, then after a while.
