# I'm Bored

> "I'm bored" is a useless thing to say. I mean, you live in a great, big, vast world that you've seen none percent of. Even the inside of your own mind is endless; it goes on forever, inwardly, do you understand? The fact that you're alive is amazing, so you don't get to say 'I'm bored.'

I'm tempted to be pedantic and point out that when people say "I'm bored", they're usually not referring to a lack of things to do, but rather that they're in a position where they are unable to do those things -- they're stuck in a boring lecture or doing a boring assignment, or physically unable to travel in visit the world for some reason or another. But that would be missing the point of the quote. Instead, I think this quote is suggesting that we all take time to be more creative, to let our mind wander and explore new ideas. And I think there is definitely an interesting case to be made for that.

In the video ["Why Boredom is Good For You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKPwKFigF8U), science communicator Veritasium examines the science that seems to suggest that boredom makes you more creative, altruistic, and introspective. Veritasium then comments on how in modern society, the ubiquity of social media and the ease of accessing it makes it easier to avoid boredom than ever before, and speculates how that might affect creativity, self-reflection, and even mental health. 

Veritasium says that science defines boredom as a position, not of having nothing to do, but rather as a situation where all possible options seem unappealing to you -- simply thinking and reflecting is unpleasant. I think that the point that Louis CK is trying to make here is the same as Veritasium, just approached from a different angle. He suggests that simply thinking and reflecting on yourself should not be seen as unpleasant or boring. Contemplating one's own humanity is an important part of living, and can be an extremely enriching and useful experience.
