# Still I Rise

I really liked this poem. It fits nicely into nearly any social movement, any revolution, any rising up of an oppressed or marginalized group. While there are several allusions to the specifics of Civil Rights in America, the poem is really quite flexible in how it can be interpreted.

An common pattern in a lot of revolutionary literature is a feeling of inevitability -- we are bound to succeed, which serves both as a reminder that what is being fought for is _right_, but also that we ought to remain persistent and persevere, ought not to give up hope. Songs like "We shall overcome" or "Old Man River" both exhibit this, but I think Angelou expresses this idea particularly beautifully in this poem, particularly in the lines "Just like moons and like suns, / With the certainty of tides, / Just like hopes springing high, / Still I'll rise". I really like the implication that social progress is a fundamental part of the way the world works, that society _must_ move forward, just as the sun must rise or the tide come and go.
