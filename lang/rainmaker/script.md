My father hated lawyers all his life.
He wasn't a great guy, my old man.
He drank and beat up my mother.



He beat me up, too.

So you might think I became
a lawyer just to piss him off.

But you'd be wrong.

I've wanted to be a lawyer
ever since I read

about the civil rights lawyers
in the '50s and '60s,

and the amazing uses
they found for the law.

They did what a lot of people
thought was the impossible.

They gave lawyers a good name.

And so I went to law school.

And it did piss my father off,

but he was pissed off anyway.

In my first year, he got drunk one day,



fell of a ladder manufactured
by the company he worked for,

and he didn't know who to sue first.

Now, he died a couple of months after that.

Now, some of my classmates,

they knew they were going straight
from school into the top law firms,

thanks mostly to their family connections.

Now, the only connections I had

were made in the places
where I tended bar for 3 years,

so I could pay my tuition.

And while I still had plans

to shine the blazing light of justice
into every dark corner,

what I really needed right now was a job.

And badly.

Because there are too many
lawyers in Memphis.

This city's infested with them.

I don't think so.

I can't think of anything more embarrassing...

- No.
- ...than telling people...

...I work for a guy like Bruiser Stone.

Negative.

I mean, he's a lawyer,
and they call him Bruiser.

That's how desperate I am.

Sure.

Shut the door.

No, not that. Not that either.

Sure.

Sure.

Let's make it... Let's make it my house.

Okay.

I really pity the poor FBI technician

that's gonna have to extract
the data from that conversation.

Live sharks in a lawyer's office.

It's a joke. Get it?

So, Prince,

is this the law student
you were telling me about?

Yes, sir. I just finished my third year
at Memphis state.

Couldn't you use him around here?

Look, I'll vouch for him.

The boy needs a job.

He's tended bar at our clubs.

This'll be a great place
for you to work, Rudy.

This'll be...

...a great place for you to work.

You can see what real lawyers do.

Now, it ain't exactly a salaried position.

It isn't?

I expect my associates
to pay for themselves,

generate their own fees.

Talk to me.

How exactly does that work?

Well, Rudy, you draw $1,000 a month,

and you get to keep one third
of all the fees that you generate.

Now, if you can't cover your draw
at the end of each month,

you owe me the balance.

Do you understand?

Sounds fair to me, Rudy.

And that's a hell of a deal, really.

You can make a lot of money this way.

I'll tell you something, Rudy.

That's the only way I operate.

And I'll get you a lot of good cases.

I have cases.

I have two cases right now.

One is a will that I'm drafting
for an old woman.

She's loaded, too. She's worth millions.

And then I have this other case.

It's an insurance case.

Great Benefit. You heard of 'em.

You got these clients signed?

I'm on my way to see 'em right now.

And they'll listen to me, too.

I helped 'em over at a law workshop.

All right, I'm gonna have you talk to

an associate of mine, Deck Schifflet.

He used to work with these
big insurance companies.

He handles all the high-powered
stuff around here.

Hey, Deck!

Deck! Damn it.

You got the paperwork on this stuff?

- In my car.
- Good.

Hey, good lookin'!

This is Deck Schifflet.

This man will get you plugged in.

What I want you to do,

I want you to draw up a lawsuit
against this Great Benefit,

and you put my name on it.

We're gonna file it today.

Thank you.

Rudy, you're gonna learn a lot.

Rudy, I'm glad you came here.

You're making good choices already, son.

All right, well, thank you.

- Okay, thank you.
- I appreciate it.

Close the door on your way out now, okay?

Law offices. May I help you?

This is an office, there's people in it.

If there's somebody in the office,
you can't have it, it's off limits.

This is the bathroom.

- Just a minute.
- Sorry.

So, are you an associate here?

Sort of. Not really.

I'm actually not a lawyer yet.

Bruiser usually asks me to review
the insurance cases when they come in.

I used to work for specific
mutual insurance company.

I got sick of that. I went to law school.

Well, when did you finish law school?

5 years ago.

See, I'm having a little trouble
with the bar exam.

I sat for it 6 times.

- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah. When do you take yours?

- I take it in, like, 3 weeks.
- Oh, yeah.

- It's that hard?
- Pretty rough, I'll say.

I took it a year ago.

I don't think I'm gonna take it again.

Anyway, this is Bruiser's law library.

If you want to get anything out of the fridge

or use the fridge, you can
put your name on stuff.

They'll eat it anyway. Put that in for me.

It's only rice. What the hell.

- Daisy!
- Yeah.

We made a mess here.
Get that up, huh?

- Sure, deck.
- Anyway...

So wait, what happens
when you have to go to court?

I've actually gone a few times myself.

I haven't gotten caught.

There's so many lawyers here,
it's impossible to keep up with us.

Bruiser owns all this.

Oh! Nice!

You can't call it a firm exactly.

It's every man for himself.

You'll learn.

What, are you moving?

Evicted.

Here's the policy.

What do you think?

Well, this is the scratch-and-sniff
armpit of the industry.

What are their grounds for denial?

Oh, well, everything.

They first denied it just on principle,

and then they said that leukemia
was a pre-existing condition,

and then they said leukemia
wasn't covered in the policy.

I got 7 letters here.

Have all the premiums been paid?

According to Miss Black,
she paid every single one of them.

They're bastards!

This is a typical debit insurance scam.

The Blacks call it street-surance.

So what do I do?

You sign 'em up. Sign 'em all up.

To J. Lyman Stone.

- All right.
- Yeah.

I'll help you on this one.

All right. Well, thank you. I appreciate it.

There's nothing more thrilling

than nailing an insurance company.

Hi, Mrs. Black. It's Rudy Baylor.

Remember? I'm handling
your case against Great Benefit.

I met you over at the Memphis
state law workshop.

Well, come in.

Come in. I'm sorry about them crazy dogs.

Oh, that's okay.

I thought you was a Jehovah's witness.

- Where's Buddy?
- He's out in the car.

Where's he going?

Buddy isn't going nowhere.

He ain't right in the head.
War injury. Korea.

You know them metal detectors
at the airport?

He can walk through one buck naked,

and the thing would go off.

He's got a plate in his head.

Oh!

That's awful.

How's Donny Ray?

Well, good days and bad.

"Plate in head."

You want to meet him?

Maybe later.

Now...

Great Benefit first denied
your claim last August

when Donny Ray was diagnosed.

Why'd y'all wait till now to consult a lawyer?

Stupid, I guess.

I just kept writing 'em,

and they kept writing me back,

and this here's the latest one.

"Dear Mrs. Black,

"on 7 prior occasions the company
has denied your claim in writing.

"We now deny it for the 8th and final time.

"You must be stupid, stupid, stupid.

"Sincerely, Everett Lufkin,
Vice President of Claims."

I don't believe this.

You're the lawyer.

Mom says nice things about you.

She says you're suing those bastards
over at Great Benefit.

Gonna make 'em pay, huh?

That's right. That's right.

- Hi, mama.
- Hi, honey.

Well, before we can file a claim,

I need all three of you to sign this.

Is daddy comin' in?

Well, he said he wasn't.

Some days he comes in,
and some days he don't.

Well, this is a contract.

What's in it?

Oh, the usual.

It's standard language.

It basically says that

y'all hire us to be your attorneys,

and we take care of the case for you.

We handle any expenses
that we might have,

and then we get one third of any recovery.

Well, why does it take
two pages to say all that?

Don't light that.

No wonder I'm dying.

And all three of us have to sign it?

Yes, ma'am, all three.
Just where your name is.

Well, he said he wasn't coming in.

Take the pen and go out there
and make him sign the damn thing.

I guess I could.

Now, Buddy, you gotta sign this paper,

so Donny Ray can get
that operation he needs,

and I don't want no trouble out of you.

I'll take that damn bottle

and throw it across Union street.

Now, sign the damn thing.
Come on, hurry up.

I know you must think they're crazy.

They're nice folks.

Hey, man.

Hey, your nose is bleedin'.

Mrs. Black!

Hold your head up.

Mrs. Black!

- All right, all right.
- It's okay. I got it.

He's bleedin'.

Put your head back.
Put your head back. Come on.

Come on, put it back.

Oh, sweetie, okay. It'll be all right.

I got it. I got it.

Okay, okay.

Okay, I got it.

You're gonna be all right.

Where's the paper?

Donny Ray, why don't you just rest a little bit?

You can wait. You can wait.
You don't have to do this now.

- No, no. I want to do this now.
- Okay.

All right, all right, You can do it. You can do it.

Go ahead.

You're doing it.

Miss Birdie, it's Rudy Baylor.

What?

Who is it?

It's Rudy Baylor.

We met at the law workshop
at Memphis state.

- Oh, yes! Oh, come in, come in.
- Well, thank you, thank you.

- How are you doing today?
- Fine, fine.

Miss Birdie, I wanted to
talk to you about your will.

- I wanna cut my children out of my will.
- I know.

- Cut, cut, cut.
- Cut, cut, cut. I know.

I had trouble sleeping last night,

'cause I was worried about your estate.

Now, if you're not careful, Miss Birdie,

the government is just gonna
get a big chunk of this.

Now, a lot of these taxes can be avoided

with a little bit of careful estate planning.

Oh, that legal gobbledygook.

I suppose you want your name
in the will somewhere.

Of course not.

Lawyers are always wanting
their names in my wills.

No, ma'am. Well, there are
all kinds of lawyers.

But what I do need from you is,
for purposes of estate planning,

I do need to know where the money is.

Is it in bonds or stocks or cash?

Now, Rudy, not so fast, not so fast.

Okay, ma'am.

So, we have this money somewhere.

Who are we gonna leave it to?

Well...

I want it all to go to the reverend
Kenneth Chandler.

Do you know him?

He's on television all the time now
out of Dallas.

Got this curly gray hair premature,

and he wouldn't dream of
touching it up, you know?

I want him to have the money.

Forgive me, Miss Birdie.

What?

I just have a real problem

drafting a will or any instrument

that's gonna cut out family

and that's gonna replace it

and convey the bulk of this estate

to a TV personality.

Well, he's a man of God!

I realize that.

I know.

Is there any way we could
attack this in more of a...

Do you have to give him everything?

Could it be more, say, 25%?

He's got a lot of overhead,

and his jet is getting old.

His jet is getting old?

Now, Rudy, I want you to just please
draw it up the way I ask

and bring it back to me,
so I can review it, all right?

Here's the hustlers when
they were still young and sweet.

Cut, cut, cut.

You come back now, huh?

Oh, I will, I will.

Thank you.

No. Thank you.

Is that a little apartment back there?

Used to be.

What do you think about my garden?

Oh, that's a fine-looking garden.

Do you do all the work on this yourself?

Most of it.

I pay a young boy to cut
the grass for me once a week.

$30. Can you believe it?

Used to be 5.

Well, I don't suppose you'd be interested

in renting this place out now, would you?

I couldn't afford much, though.

I could let you have it quite reasonably,

if you'd assist me with a few chores
around the place.

Sure, sure.

Perhaps a little weed pulling now and then.

Weed pull... Sure.
Weed pulling's my specialty.

Go to hospitals all the time.

Bruiser has contacts
down at the main precinct,

guys he grew up with.

They feed him accident reports
every morning.

- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

What does Bruiser expect me to do?

You get the case. You find the victims.

You sign 'em up to the law firm
of J. Lyman Stone.

Put the case together.

So I should solicit?

What did they teach you in law school?

Well, they didn't teach me
how to chase ambulances.

Well, you better learn quick,
or you're gonna starve.

No comment. All you have to do
is ask for a doctor,

and we can admit you right here. Sure.

- Nice flowers.
- Thanks.

- William.
- How're you doing, Deck?

All right. 346.

Dr. Wells.

- Morning. How're you doing?
- Good morning. How are you?

Good. Good to see you.

Don't act like a lawyer.

Hmm! "Do not enter."

How're you doing, Mr. McKenzie?

How are my tests?

Gall bladder. Wrong fish.

Mr. Van Landel.

Good afternoon, Mr. Van Landel.

Can you hear me, Mr. Van Landel?

Hi.

Who are you?

I'm Deck Schifflet, para-lawyer.

You haven't talked to any insurance
companies, have you?

No.

Good. Don't talk to 'em,

because they're just out to screw you.

- Do you have a lawyer?
- No.

My firm handles more car wrecks
than anybody in Memphis.

Insurance companies are terrified of us,

and we don't charge a dime.

Can you wait till my wife gets back?

Your wife, Mr. van...

Sorry.

I'm very sorry, Mr. Van Landel.

Very sorry.

Where is your wife, Mr. Van Landel?

She's gonna be back in a little while.

Well, I'm gonna have to talk
to her down in my office,

because there's a ton of
information that I need.

Just sign right there.

Now, remember, don't talk to
anybody except your doctor.

There are gonna be
people coming at you

from every direction
offering you settlements.

I do not want you under any
circumstances to sign anything

without me reviewing it first.
You understand?

My number is on this card.

You can call me 24 hours a day.

Mr. Rudy Baylor's number is on the back.

You can call that number
for him any time, okay?

Do you have any questions?

- No.
- Good.

We're gonna get you a bunch of money.

Let's go.

I'm real sorry about your leg.

I'd like to be alone please.

And that is how it's done. Piece of cake.

What if the guy had a lawyer?

We came with nothing.

If he'd have thrown us out of his room

for whatever reason, what have we lost?

A little dignity.

Maybe a little self-respect.

You see...

In law school, Rudy, they don't
teach you what you need to know.

It's all theories and lofty notions

and big fat ethics books.

What's wrong with ethics?

Nothing, I guess.

I mean, I believe a lawyer
should fight for his client,

refrain from stealing money,
and try not to lie.

You know, the basics.

That was blatant ambulance chasing.

Right, but who cares?

There's a lot of lawyers out there.

It's a marketplace. It's a competition.

What they don't teach you
in law school can get you hurt.

How do you know when a lawyer is lying?

His lips are moving.

What's the difference between
a hooker and a lawyer?

A hooker will stop screwing you
after you're dead.

Everybody loves lawyer jokes,
especially lawyers.

They're even sort of proud of 'em.

Why do you suppose that is?

When a third party is on defend,

he may also be used by the plaintiff
to bring in a third party...

What the hell are you doing?

Oh, I'm studying.

I thought we was gonna study
on our own time.

I know, Bruiser, but look, man,

the bar exam is next week, all right?

It is next week.

I'm scared, man.

Hey, Rudy, look, you want to study,

why don't you run over to the hospital
and study with Deck?

I'm not gonna study with...

I'm not gonna study with Deck.

Yeah, I got a police report here.

Do we represent her, this victim here?

Well, not yet.

Why don't you run down to the hospital
and check it out?

Maybe you could sign her up, hmm?

Where did this all come from?

Are you gonna tell them where
all this stuff came from?

I know what's going on
the second I lay eyes on them.

Like I'm 10 years old,

my father crying in the bedroom,

my mother sitting at the kitchen table

with blood all over her face

telling me that daddy's sorry,

and he's never gonna do it again.

Jeez!

Just tell me yes!

Why are you doing this to me?!

It's always the same with you!

You make me so crazy!

Kelly Riker was admitted to
St. Peter's hospital 3 days ago,

at midnight, I might add,

with assorted injuries.

The cops found her lying
on the sofa in the den,

beat to hell, wrapped in a blanket, naked.

Cliff Riker, her spouse,

was obviously intoxicated,

highly agitated,

and initially wanted to dish out to the cops

what he was giving his wife.

Which was, by the way,

a severe beating with
an aluminum baseball bat.

Evidently his weapon of choice.

Let's talk about Miss Birdie's millions.

- Colleen--
- No, I want to talk about Cliff.

I want to talk about
what happened to Cliff.

He spent the night in jail.
His family bailed him out.

He's due in court in a week.
Nothing will happen.

All right.

Colleen Janice Birdsong.

She did indeed inherit
a couple of million bucks

from her late second husband.

But lawyers, bad trust
department investments,

and the IRS totally devoured the estate.

All except for about $40,000,

which Miss Birdie

probably tucked in her mattress
for all we know.

Sorry.

# You are my sunshine #

# My only sunshine #

# You make me happy #

# When skies are gray #

# Da da da da da #

# Da da da da da #

# Do not take my sunshine away ##

Oh, good morning, Rudy.

Isn't it a lovely day?

Oh, yeah, it's... beautiful.

Oh, here's my mulch.

That's right. There, there.

Right there. Yes.

Stop it, stop it, stop it!

All right. Just put it right there now.

My yard boy will get it.

Just right down there.

Isn't that a fine bunch of mulch?

Excuse me.

I'm not one to meddle, but...

Are you all right?

Are you in pain?

No, but thanks.

Okay, well, I'm right up here.

I'm just studying for the bar exam.

So, if you need anything, just holler at me.

- Okay.
- Anything. All right?

I'll get it for you.

My name is Rudy Baylor.

Kelly Riker. Nice to meet you.

Kelly, it's nice to meet you, too.

Why don't you sit down?

Go ahead. Take a seat.

What school do you go to?

I went to Austin Peay

and then law school at Memphis state.

I always wanted to go to college,

but it didn't work out.

- Did you?
- Yeah.

I always thought I'd go,

but it didn't work out.

What kind of lawyer do you want to be?

Well, I enjoy trial work, so...

I'd like to spend my days in the courtroom.

Defending criminals?

Maybe. Maybe.

They're entitled to a good defense.

They have a right to their day in court.

Murderers?

Most murderers can't afford a private lawyer.

Rapists and...

...child molesters?

No.

Men who beat their wives?

Criminal work is a real rare specialty.

I'll probably be doing more...

...civil litigation.

Like lawsuits and stuff.

- Right.
- Yeah.

- Excuse me.
- Mm-hm.

Rudy Baylor.

Hey! Hey, there. It's me.

What're you doing?

How's the fishing going?

It's going well.

I'm actually talking to the prospect right now.

Well, you better sign her up.

What... Rudy? Rudy, can you hear me?

- I enjoyed meeting you.
- Rudy?

Yeah, thanks for the company.

Hey, tomorrow night?

Maybe.

Time's up. Pencils down.

Please pass your test booklets to your right,

so that your proctors may gather them up.

In my first year at law school,

everybody loved everybody else,

because we were all studying the law.

And the law was a noble thing.

By my third year,

you were lucky if you weren't
murdered in your sleep.

People stole exams,

hid research materials from the library,

and lied to the professors.

Such is the nature of the profession.

Right here.

Half an hour ago, her husband came in

and threw a bowl of soup at her,

because she just won't get it through
her head how much he loves her.

This is my room.

Pregnant at 18, married,
then a miscarriage,

probably because he beat her up,

and still, she can't leave him.

You are gonna have to help me.

Everything I've ever seen

tells me that this girl is a loser,

scarred and broken and
maybe even dangerous.

But I've never really seen
anyone like her before.

And instead of running away,

all I want to do is protect her.

Visiting hours are over, hon.
You kids need to wrap it up.

So...

He should be shot.

Any man who'd beat his wife
with an aluminum bat

needs to be shot.

How did you find out?

There are police reports,
there are ambulance reports,

there are hospital records.

How long are you gonna wait, Kelly,

until he decides to hit you
in the head with that bat of his?

'Cause that could kill you, you know.
That'd be it.

A couple of good shots to the skull,

- and that would be it.
- Stop it!

Don't tell me how it feels.

Look at me, Kelly.

Can I ask you something?

Do you have a father or a brother?

Why?

Because if my daughter got beat
the way your husband beat you,

I swear to God I'd break his neck.

No big brother?

No.

No one to take care of me, you know?

Kelly, I'll try to help you any way I can,

but you have to file for divorce.

Do it now while you're in the hospital
being treated for the last beating.

It'll sail through.

What better proof is there than that?

I... can't file for a divorce.

Why not?

Because he'll kill me.

He tells me so all the time.

That's not gonna happen.

Could you pass me a pillow,
please, and put it under my foot?

There's one over there.

Here.

- That okay?
- Yeah.

Yeah? All right.

Could you pass me my gown, too, please?

Yeah.

Thanks.

You need some help putting it on?

No. Just turn around.

All right.

Hey!

Oh! Who are you?

I live here. Who the hell are you?

Oh, my gosh! I'm Delbert's wife.

Delbert? Who the hell is Delbert?

What do you... How did you get in here?

Birdie gave me the key.

Yes. Who are you?

I am the person who lives here.
Do you understand that?

You have no right to be in here.

- This is a private residence.
- Oh, yeah, right!

Some place. Get a grip.
Birdie wants to see you.

"Agreements are permanent,

"and restrictions mentioned above herein..."

What is this?

Well, you must be the lawyer.

I'm Rudy Baylor.

I'm Delbert Birdsong, Birdie's youngest.

He yelled at me.

He told me to get out of his apartment.

- That so?
- You're damn right that's so.

That goes for the both of you.

I don't want neither one of you
up there going through my stuff.

That's private property.

I come home to check on mama,

and, damn, she's got a stinkin' lawyer
livin' with her.

You been messin' with my mama's will?

Well, she's your mama.
Why don't you ask her?

She won't say a word.

Oh, well...

then neither can I.

That's a lawyer-client privilege.

But I tell you what.

- I made a couple of phone calls.
- Mm-hm.

- Verifying some accounts.
- Mm-hm.

Your mama's second husband

left her an enormous fortune.

How big?

Big.

Big.

I hope you're not meddling, boy.

Mama, wouldn't you just love
to come and visit with us

down in Florida for a while?

You'd love it down there, mama.

Mama, come on back in
and get some cake, mama.

I'll get her some milk.

We're close to the fountain of youth.

We ain't but 33 miles away
and 180 miles from Disney world.

How're you feeling, Donny Ray?

Great.

Don't I look fantastic?

You feel up to this?

Yeah. Let's go already.

All right.

A lawyer's not supposed to become
personally involved with his client.

But there's all kinds of lawyers.

And all kinds of clients, too.

You okay, baby?

Riker!

Can I get you guys anything else?

You want something?

I'll have a shot of Jack Daniels, please.

What's it gonna do, kill me?

- Miss Birdie, this is my friend Donny Ray.
- Hello.

Oh, Donny Ray, I'm so glad
to have you come over and visit.

Hello, Miss Birdie.

Where... Oh!

There you go.

You just come right over here and sit down.

Just have a rest.

You have me all...

...blocked off here.

Well...

Sorry, Miss Birdie. I got to take
a break. My back's killing me.

I almost forgot. This came for you.

Oh, my God!

Oh! Isn't it exciting?

I'm so proud of you.

- I passed the bar.
- All right.

Hey, come on. Here's to Rudy.

Congratulations on passing the bar.

What the hell is that?

Iced tea.

- Congratulations, Rudy.
- Thanks, Deck.

That's some good work, boys.

I got a check today from
the Van Landel settlement.

I'm giving you boys a bonus.

5,500 each.

Thank you.

Sign up some more cases, huh?

Okay.

So, are we gonna be ready
for tomorrow morning?

9 o'clock?

We're gonna argue Great
Benefit's motion to dismiss.

Yeah, I think we're ready. We're ready.

So, Deck and I have been
going over it. I think we're ready.

I hope so, because I might...

I might have you handle
some of that argument, Rudy.

It would be awfully embarrassing
if we lose this case

on a dismissal.

Boss?

Okay, I got to go.

Food's on me.

Enjoy your meat.

Thanks a lot, Bruiser. Appreciate it.

Something's about to go down.

I'm sure of it.

He never split money like that before.

What do you think's behind his generosity?

Come on, man.

Oh, yeah?

Here.

Yesterday, one of Bruiser's ex-partners
testified before a grand jury.

I think he's cut a deal.

It's just a matter of time
before he's singing on Bruiser.

- So what? So what?
- So...

You're gonna have to make a move.

Make a move? Deck, I just got here.

Yeah? Well, things might get a little hot.

Jury-tampering, tax evasion,

money-skimming, you name it.

I'm nervous, real nervous.

Well, hey, what are you nervous about?
They can't arrest us.

Listen...

Supposing they come in with
subpoenas and hacksaws.

Huh? They can do that.

They've been known to do
that in racketeering cases.

They come in, they confiscate the files,

they haul the computers out.

What's that leave us?

I'm not worried about being arrested.

I'm worried about my job.

All right, so what are you saying here?

Let's bolt.

How much money you got?

I got... $5,500.

Me, too.

We can rent a small office,

$500 a month.

We operate on a shoestring
for the first 6 months.

It'll be beautiful.

We split everything, everything,

right down the middle, 50-50.

Costs, expenses, profits, everything,

right down the middle.

What's the matter?

You don't want to be my partner?

No, it's not... they...

it's not that. It's just that you...

You're hitting me with this right now,

and I mean, you got to
give me a minute, all right?

I mean, you can't just spring it on me.

We have to act fast.

All right. Let's do it.

We'll do it for a while,

see how it goes.

How many files do you have?

I... I got 3.

Get them out of there. Take them home,

but don't get caught, okay?

Is somebody watching us?

The feds.

I'm eatin' too fast.

Sorry.

Hey!

Listen, I went by the office this morning.

The FBI was chaining up the front door.

- Yeah.
- Is Bruiser comin'?

I doubt it.

Arrest warrants have been issued
for both Bruiser and Prince.

Oh, man!

Just relax. You can do this. It's just a motion.

- About what?
- Come on.

- Who, me?
- Yeah.

- Oh, come on! I'm gonna be sick!
- Come on.

You know this case. You're gonna be fine.

Listen, I don't even have my license.

We don't need a license. Come on.

I've memorized the Black files cold.

I've read all the books on jurisprudence,

the rules of evidence and discovery.

But I take one look around the courtroom

and I realize I haven't even been born yet.

Excuse me,sir? Your honor...

I'm here for the Black
vs. Great Benefit hearing.

And who are you?

Rudy Baylor.

I work for J. Lyman Stone.

Oh, you work for J. Lyman.

Staunch supporter of the tobacco lobby.

Where's Mr. Stone?

Honestly, your honor, I don't know.

He was supposed to meet me here,

and I don't know where he is.

Well, why doesn't that surprise me?

So, what do you want?
You want a continuance.

No, your honor.

I am prepared to argue this motion.

Are you a lawyer?

Well, I just passed the bar,

and these are my clients.

Mr. Stone filed this on my behalf

until I passed the bar.

Well, you got a hell of a lot of nerve

walking into my courtroom without a license.

Now, get the hell out of here,
get your license,

and then you come back.

Get a license!

Come back when you got a damn license!

May it please the court...

For the record, my name
is Leo F. Drummond

of Tinley-Brit,

counsel for Great Benefit,

and I say

if this young man has
passed the bar exam,

your honor, let him argue the case.

We welcome him to big-time litigation.

You have no objection, Mr. Drummond?

If it please the court,

I would be honored to introduce Mr. Baylor

to the practice of law
in the great state of Tennessee.

Judge, you can give him the oath right now,

and I'll be pleased to stand for him.

Are you certain you're prepared
to proceed, Mr. Baylor?

Abso...

Yeah. Your honor, yes.

Very well, then. Raise your right hand.

Do you solemnly swear, Rudy Baylor,

that you will support
the constitution and the laws

of the United States and
the state of Tennessee

faithfully and honorably,

conduct yourself in the practice
of your profession

to the best of your skills
and abilities, so help you God?

I do.

Okay, fine, fine. That's it. Let's move on.

- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

Welcome to the war.

Sworn in by a fool and
vouched for by a scoundrel.

Harvey!

I'm a lawyer at last.

Come on in.

May I, Harv?

Sure.

Sit down.

This lawsuit bothers me, Mr. Baylor.

I wouldn't use the word "frivolous",

but I'm not impressed with
the merits of it to be Frank.

I'm gonna try to sneak some gym time in.

In fact, I'm really tired
of these type of lawsuits.

Don't make no excuses.

I'm inclined to grant the motion to dismiss.

Now, you can refile it
in federal court, you know,

take it somewhere else.

I don't want it clogging up my docket.

Now, excuse me while I go to the can.

You, too.

Rudy...

I'm a very expensive lawyer

from a very expensive firm and...

I've had a lot of cases.

I can hit pretty close to
the center of the dart board,

and I told my clients, Great Benefit,

that cost alone here gonna be a big deal.

And for you, too. Your side, too.

Now, they've authorized me

to offer you and your clients...

$50,000 to settle this thing out.

And I may even be able to raise
that figure up as high as...

maybe 75,000.

No admission of liability, you understand.

'Course...

If you say no,

then it's gonna be world war III.

My turn now. May I, Harv?

Sure.

There's not much of a lawsuit here,

I'm afraid, son.

But maybe I could lean on Leo

to make you an offer of a settlement.

They'll probably want
to throw some money at you

to keep from paying Leo
a thousand bucks a minute.

But he already offered me
the cost of the defense.

Oh, really? How much?

75,000.

Jeez!

Well, looky here, son,

you'd be crazy not to take that.

You think so?

75,000? Jeez!

That's a... bunch of money.

Doesn't sound like Leo.

Well, he's a... great guy.

Hmm.

So?

That was not a meeting in chambers.
That was an ambush.

- What happened?
- They tag-teamed me.

Yeah.

Think they would have done that to Bruiser?

- Nah.
- No, I don't think so.

- Bruiser's too savvy for that.
- Yeah.

So what?

They offered me 75,000.

Good. Take it.

Our third is 25,000. We need the money.

Judge Hale is serious
about dismissing this case.

He's an just an old angry man

who's been sitting on that bench too long.

I say the best thing we can do

is grab what we can to make
things easier on his parents.

The insurance company
made an offer to settle.

What kind of offer?

$75,000.

They figure that's what it's gonna cost

to pay their lawyers to defend the case.

Oh!

Son of a bitches think
they can just buy us off.

That's exactly what they think.

You better talk to him.

Do you wanna settle, Rudy?

I mean, some of the money is yours.

No way.

I wanna expose these people.

Mama, could you get me
a glass of water, please?

Sure, baby.

Whatever you get out of this case,

take care of my family with it.

I really love them.

I can't help thinking that

while we're all out there
scrambling around for an edge,

like we're never gonna die,

this boy's looking right at it.

And he's doing it almost alone.

I can't even begin to imagine
the courage it must take.

Hello?

Guess who died last night.

Who?

Do you ever sleep?

Harvey Hale. 62.

Quite a pedigree.

- Judge Hale?
- Yeah.

Croaked with a heart attack.

Dropped dead in his swimming pool.

- You gotta be kidding me.
- Uh-uh.

- You gotta be kidding me.
- Mm-mm.

Guess what newly made judge was
assigned Great Benefit case in his place.

How in the hell am I supposed
to know that, Deck?

Tyrone Kipler.

Black Harvard civil-rights lawyer.

He can't stand Tinley-Brit.

And he's tough on insurance companies,

sues them all the time.

Great luck for us.

- All right, all right, all right.
- You know what a rainmaker is kid?

The bucks are gonna be falling from the sky!

Okay. It's 5:00 right now.
What time're you coming down?

- I'll be down in a minute.
- All right, get down here.

We gotta talk about fast-tracking, all right?

- Coffee's on the way.
- Okay.

Mr. Drummond...

You've objected to
the fast-tracking of this case.

What's the problem?

Well, your honor,

this issue's already been ruled upon

by Judge Hale.

The preparations required
for fast-tracking the case

place an undue burden
on both parties, I believe.

Nonsense.

Let me ask you something, Mr. Drummond.

As a defense lawyer,

have you ever agreed

to the fast-tracking of a lawsuit?

Why, your honor, I believe I have.

Fine.

Give me the name of the case
and the court it was in.

Well...

Well, your honor,

I have to get back to you on that.

Well, call me this afternoon by 3:00.

I don't believe I'm gonna be in before 3:00.

Well, call me when you get in.

I'm very anxious to hear about this case
you agreed to fast-track.

Yes, sir.

This boy is about to die, gentlemen.

You do agree that we need
to record his testimony.

Yes, indeed.

Of course, your honor.

It's just my trial calendar is
pushing me around pretty good.

How about next Thursday afternoon?

Great for me, your honor.

I'm sorry, your honor.

That's a week from today.

I believe I'm out of town.

Yes, I am out of town Thursday.

Deposition is set for...

next Thursday afternoon at 2 p.m.

Sorry if it inconveniences the defense,

but God knows there's
enough of you guys to handle it.

Now, what's next?

Oh, your honor,

the motion to dismiss is still pending.

Ah, yes.

That motion is denied.

Well...

I guess that's it.

Gentlemen, let's go.

Congratulations on your appointment,
your honor.

Thank you, sir.

And, Mr. Drummond...

Don't forget to call me

with the name of that case
you agreed to fast-track.

I'll look around.

You in over your head, son?

Absolutely.

Now Deck wants to do an ad
on the local rap station.

And as much as I'd love to hear it,
we can't afford it.

Furnishings, bar dues,
750 for a fax machine,

400 for a lease on a computer,

a down payment
on a new second-hand car,

and we're broke again.

Deck says he's thrilled
with the way things are going.

- Rudy, hi.
- Hey, Dot.

Come in. How are you?

I'm doing good. How're you doing?

Good.

Listen, I'm going up to
Cleveland Wednesday night.

It's the headquarters of Great Benefit.

I'm gonna take depositions
from all the executives up there.

- Oh!
- So...

And don't worry about expenses, either.

We're gonna take care of it.

- Thank you, Rudy.
- It's no problem.

It's awkward.

My associate, Deck Schifflet.

- How do you do?
- Hi.

Hey, Rudy!

Tyrone's here.

Okay.

- The judge is here.
- Oh!

- Here, wait, Dot. Give me that.
- Oh!

Thank you.

- Hello.
- Hello.

Come right in.

- Thank you.
- This is Mrs. Black.

His honor, Tyrone Kipler.

It's a privilege to meet you.

Well, the privilege is mine.

Oh, come on in.

There's not a lot of room here.

Tight.

Let's take a look outside.

Is that all right with you, son?

Sure, okay.

All right, I'll show you the way.

I'm looking at a team of lawyers

who are pulling down a $1,000 an hour,

and I hate them.

From their lofty perch,

pissing down on the whole
justice system with disdain.

I used to hate them, because
I wasn't good enough for them.

Now, I hate them for who they represent

and what they represent.

Your honor, how are you?

Fine, sir.

Hope the dogs didn't startle you.

We're doing this thing outside.

It's a little cramped inside.

Just have a seat here.

All right. How're you doing?

Good.

Thank you.

Hey, Donny Ray.

Hey.

You've already met Judge Kipler.

Howdy.

This is Leo F. Drummond

and associates.

This here is Tammy.
She's the court reporter.

Hi.

Swear him in.

Do you swear the testimony
you are about to give

will be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

- so help you God?
- Yes, I do.

- I told him...
- I know, I know, I know.

Come here, come here, come here.
Don't worry about it.

Don't worry about it.
It's just a deposition.

Donny Ray, I'm Leo Drummond.

I represent Great Benefit,

and I'm very sorry...

I'm very sorry to be here

under these circumstances.

Well, we wouldn't be here

if your clients had done
what they should've done.

I beg your pardon? I didn't hear that.

Hey, kid, you want a stick of gum?

- Sure.
- Here.

- Did you break your arm?
- Yeah.

- You had an accident?
- Why?

Well, I'm a lawyer, and...

give this to your mom.

- You his mom?
- Uh-uh.

Oh, yeah. Maybe I can get you
some money for the accident.

Why don't you go help with the display?

Okay. I'll go help this man first.

Oh, no, I got it. It's fine.

Can I help you, sir?

Oh, I'm just looking.

There's a cinema down the street.

Buy a ticket. Center section, back row.

Be there in 30 minutes.

Okay.

Cliff wants me to have a baby.

Well, you have a decision to make.

He's become obsessed with sex.

He thinks it's going to keep us together.

Listen, I really don't want to talk about that.

I just wanted to see you.

I think I can smell her perfume
all the way to Cleveland.

It's hard keeping my mind on
Leo Drummond and his people.

They'll be flying in, first class,

and after a leisurely dinner,

they'll meet in some board room
and discuss my total destruction.

Around the time I'm checking into Motel 6,

they'll be sleeping soundly in their suites.

And they'll wake up fresh and rested

and ready for war.

It's my deposition,

but it's their turf.

Young Rudy Baylor.

Just on time, too.

Mr. Drummond.

Get this boy some coffee, Tyler.

- Jack Underhall.
- Rudy Baylor.

Young lawyer is always a hungry lawyer.

All these boys claims, underwriting...

There must be a hundred yearsof legal
experience gathered around the table.

My staff has flunked the bar exam 6 times.

Now, Rudy, don't be intimidated

by all these boys on this side of the table.

I guarantee, you get them on the golf course,

they fold like a cheap suit.

Let's see... Let's see what we got here.

I think maybe it's appropriate

to start with the corporate designee,

Jack Underhall here.

I don't think so.

I beg your pardon?

Well, you heard me.

I want to start with Jackie Lemancyzk,
the claims handler.

I think it's best we start with Mr. Underhall.

With all due respect, Mr. Drummond,
this is my deposition.

I'm gonna call these witnesses
in the order in which I see fit.

So, I'd like to start with Jackie Lemancyzk.

Maybe we should just go call the judge.

Oh, I don't believe we have to

get pugilistic this time of the morning.

I'm not admitting to being pugilistic.

We're simply having a little problem

with Jackie Lemancyzk,

this Polish woman.

What sort of problem?

She doesn't work here anymore.

Was she fired?

She resigned.

She resigned.

Well, where is she now?

Well...

She is no longer working for our client, and...

we can't produce her as a witness,

so let's move along.

All right. Russell Crockett.

Anybody in the room
named Russell Crockett?

He's gone, too.

- He was downsized.
- Downsized?

Well, what a coincidence.

Our client's going through
a periodic downsizing.

Yeah, that will happen, won't it?

How about Everett Lufkin,

Vice President of Claims.

Has he been downsized, too?

No, he's here.

- You're Everett Lufkin?
- Mm-hm.

My congratulations,

Mr. Lufkin, on your miraculous survival

of the carnage of late here at Great Benefit.

I may not be 100% today,
but I'm here in spirit.

I'm curious.

About what?

I'm just wondering.

Do you even remember
when you first sold out?

You're an arrogant little piss ant, aren't you?

I advise you to mind your manners.

You're in the big water now.

Mind my manners?

I come up here from Memphis

to depose four people,

two of whom are not here,

and you tell me to mind my manners?

Well, it's your dime.

What's your call, son?

I'm gonna depose him,

Mr. Lufkin over there,

then I'm gonna pack up,

I'm gonna go back to Memphis.

So this is how the uninsured die.

In a society filled with brilliant doctors

and state-of-the-art technology,

it's obscene to let this boy
just wither away and die.

He was covered by an insurance policy

that his mother paid good money for.

It wasn't big money, but it was good money.

I'm alone in this trial.

I'm seriously outgunned, and I'm scared,

but I'm right.

I sit here with this poor suffering kid,

and I swear revenge.

Hello?

Rudy, it's me.

What's wrong?

I need your help.

Where are you?

I'm at the store.

Okay, don't move, okay?

I'm gonna be right there.

All right.

Rudy Baylor.

She's in here.

Thanks for coming.

- What happened?
- Come on, let's show him.

I got you, Kelly. It's all right.

Oh, Rudy, I'm so glad you called.

Come, come.

Oh, you poor child.

I'm gonna take care of you now.

Don't you worry. Don't you worry.
We'll manage just fine.

All right. You know where I'll be,
if you need me.

I do, I do.

I tell myself I'll do whatever
I have to do to get her out of this.

Because this guy's never gonna stop,
until he's killed her.

Never.

Well...

Now it's a wrongful death suit.

Gazillions!

Deck!

I'm so sorry, Dot.

Well, thank you so much for coming.

I appreciate it.

It'll be okay.

Hey!

For bugs?!

(Here?!)

Thank you.

Thank you.

Enjoy your meal.

This bugging device has got...

medium-grade circuitry.

It's a weak transmitter.

Probably manufactured in Czechoslovakia.

I don't think the cops or
the feds would place this.

Somebody else is listenin'.

Who else would be listening to us?

I got a pretty good idea.

- Rudy.
- Yeah?

Just checking in.
You need anything from downtown?

No, no.

Hey, guess what.
Guess who wants to settle.

- Who?
- Dot Black.

Dot Black?!

I went by there today and...

check up on her.

- I brought her a fruitcake, yeah.
- Oh!

And she said she just
doesn't have the willpower

to stand a long trial and...

- How much?
- She said she'd take 175.

I think we should take it.

- We'll sleep on it.
- Eh...

- All right, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

All right, but I say you take it.

I know. I heard you. I'll think about it.

All right. Bye.

Son...

This family's been through a hell of a lot.

And I feel this woman wants to settle.

I'll talk to her.

You go ahead and call her.

I'll wait here one while.

I'll get back to you, Mr. Drummond.
Good day.

Well, I'm sorry about the boy.

Mm-hm.

Listen, my client wants to settle, Rudy.

Let's say, Rudy, just for the sake of
putting the numbers on the board that,

if the claim was covered,

that my client should have
paid out somewhere

around 150-175,000.

Well, if you say so.

They bugged our phones.

I do say so. And we will offer...

I guess we should...

tell Judge Kipler.

I don't think so.

Why not?

I have an idea.

A kind of a crazy idea.

Jury tampering!

I love it!

I love it!

Who's our biggest nightmare?

The judge gave us the names
of 92 potential jurors.

We investigated their backgrounds,

and we rated them
with plus or minus numbers.

What do you want me to do?

- All right. Here we go.
- What?

Any direct contact would, of course,
be a serious offense.

- What are we doing?
- We're gonna do this thing.

- Just do what I say.
- Okay.

Hello.

Yeah... Rudy Baylor, please.

This is Rudy Baylor.

This is Billy Porter.

You stopped by the shop today.

Yes. Mr. Porter.

Thank you very much for calling back.

What do you want?!

Yes, well, it's about the trial.

You know, the one you got
a jury summons for.

I'm one of the lawyers.

Uh-huh. Is this legal?

Of course it's legal, Mr. Porter.

Just don't go telling anybody.

Look, I represent this lady
whose son died of leukemia,

because the Great Benefit
insurance company

wouldn't give them the money
they needed for an operation.

That sounds awful.

You know, I had an aunt
that had that same disease.

Kept wasting away,
and my Uncle cried, and...

- I'll do what I can.
- Well, yes, sir.

Now, thank you, Mr. Porter.
You have a fine afternoon.

Bye. Bye.

What... about the aunt?

- Where'd the aunt come from?
- I don't know.

You told me to be sympathetic.
I tried to be sympathetic.

I know, but you don't have to.
Don't elaborate.

Get your coffee.

Let's go back up there.

I'm just trying to help.

- Come on!
- I'm right behind you.

Ladies and gentlemen,

what I'm about to ask

is the most important question of the day.

It's a simple question.

Can be answered yes or no.

Listen carefully.

Have any of y'all been
contacted about this case?

This is serious business.

Bingo.

We need to know now.

Let me ask it another way.

Did any of you have a conversation

recently with either Mr. Rudy Baylor

or directly behind him, Mr. Deck Schifflet?

Objection, your honor!

This is an outrage!

What are you doing, Mr. Drummond?

Your honor,

we have reason to believe that
this panel's been tampered with.

And he's accusing me.

I don't understand what
you're doing, Mr. Drummond.

Well, neither do I, your honor. Neither do I!

Approach the bench, please.

Your honor, this panel's
been tampered with.

I want proof, Leo.

I can't say without divulging

confidential information, your honor.

You are just out of your mind.

You are acting rather bizarrely.

- I'm gonna prove it.
- How?

You accuse us of something like that!

Tamper...

It's ridiculous.

Just allow me to finish
questioning the panel.

I think the truth will come forth.

Any objection, Mr. Baylor?

No, no objection.

Very well. Proceed.

Right.

What in the Sam Hill is going on up there?

Oh, it's just lawyer stuff.

Mr. Porter...

I want to ask you a direct question.

And I'd appreciate an honest response.

You ask an honest question,

I'll give you an honest answer.

Fair enough.

Did you, Mr. Porter, or did you not

have a phone conversation
a few days ago with Mr. Rudy Baylor?

Hell, no!

I thought you were gonna
give me an honest answer.

I gave you an honest answer.

Are you sure, Mr. Porter?

I'm damn sure!

Mr. Porter,

in a courthouse...

in a courthouse in the United States,

in a courthouse of justice,
state of Tennessee,

I say you did not provide an honest answer!

Don't call me a liar!

- Mr. Drummond.
- Oh, you're a liar, Mr. Porter.

You son of a bitch!

Hey, get off him!

- Order in the court!
- Oh, my God!

- He started it!
- Bailiff,

remove Mr. Porter from this courtroom.

Mr. Billy Porter, you are
excused from the jury.

Your honor,

I move to dismiss the entire panel,
your honor.

Denied.

It's been tainted.

You...

Your shoe, you left it over...

Are we ready to proceed now

with the jury selection, Mr. Drummond?

I'm ready to proceed, your honor.
I'm ready to proceed.

Thank you.

(Hello, how are we?)

We'll file it today.

- He'll go crazy.
- He already is crazy.

- He'll come after you.
- Mm-hm.

I hope he does.

This is that good processed turkey.

- Oh!
- Oh!

Well, I gotta get back to court.

I'm late. I gotta get back to court.

What about your sandwich?

Oh, I was gonna take that with me.

Good, good.

- I'll see you later.
- Mm-hm.

Okay.

How'd it go?

I served the papers on Cliff

when he was on his way to lunch.

He didn't take it too well,

but I said I was ready to rumble.

He backed down.

Hey, man, you better watch your back.

All right.

Thanks a lot, Butch. I appreciate it.

Do you solemnly swear

that the testimony you're
about to give in this cause

will be the truth, the whole truth,

and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God.

Yes, I do.

You may take the stand.

Please state your name for the record.

Mrs. Margarine Black.

Now, Mrs. Black,

you are the mother of Donny Ray Black,

who recently died of
acute myelocytic leukemia,

because the defendant, Great Benefit--

Objection.

Leading.

Sustained.

Your son,

Donny Ray, needed an operation.

Objection.

Leading.

Sustained.

Mrs. Black, did you purchase
this medical policy,

because you were concerned
about medical care for your son?

Objection.

I'm sorry, your honor.

Leading.

Mr. Baylor,

why don't you show the policy

and ask her why she bought it?

Okay.

Mr. Baylor...

You must ask to approach the witness.

Sorry, your honor.

Permission to approach the witness.

You may.

Take it easy.

Take it easy.

"Great Benefit. July 7th, 1996.

"Re: Policy 7849909886.

"Dear Mrs. Black,

"on 7 prior occasions this company
has denied your claim in writing.

"We now deny it
for the eighth and final time.

"You must be stupid, stupid, stupid."

"Sincerely Everett Lufkin,

Vice President, Claims Department."

Read it again.

Objection.

Repetitious, your honor.

Sustained.

I tender the witness.

Mr. Drummond.

Your honor.

Please remove that exhibit.

Now, Mrs. Black.

Turn it off.

Mrs. Black, why did you sue
Great Benefit for $10 million?

Is that all?

I beg your pardon.

I thought it was more than that.

- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

Your client has about a billion dollars,

and your client killed my son.

Hell, I wanted to sue for a whole lot more.

What would you do with the money?

If this jury awards you $10 million,

what're you gonna do with the money?

I'm gonna give it to the
American leukemia society.

Every cent.

I don't want a dime of your stinking money.

Realize you are under oath, Mrs. Black.

Approach the witness, your honor?

You may.

Mrs. Black, I want you
to read from the policy.

Page 16, section "K",
paragraph 14, item "E",

in which the insurance company
has in plain English wording said

that it will not pay for
experimental procedures.

Now, your lawsuit says

that your son would have
been saved if he had had

a bone marrow transplant.

Isn't it a fact, Mrs. Black,

that there are only 7,000

bone marrow transplants performed
a year in the United States?

Less than 200 in the state of Tennessee.

Objection, your honor.

He's leading the witness.

This is cross-examination.
Leading is allowed.

Overruled,

as to leading.

So, it was not covered by the policy.

Now, Mrs. Black,

who was it...

Who was it first diagnosed
your son's condition?

Well, at the very beginning,

our doctor, Dr. page.

That would be your family physician?

Yes, sir, it would.

Is he a good doctor?

He's a very good doctor.

And is it not true, Mrs. Black,

that this capable, truthful man

told you repeatedly
that a bone marrow transplant

would do your son no good,

because of the type of leukemia he had?

Well, no.

No, he did not.

He didn't say that.

Not like that, to me.

Approach the witness, your honor?

You may.

Mrs. Black, is this not
Dr. page's letterhead?

And at the bottom there,
is that not his signature?

- He can't do that.
- Yes, it is.

- Why?
- And is this not addressed to you?

Because he can't introduce
evidence that way.

- Plus it's hearsay.
- Yes, sir.

Objection, your honor.

A letter from the Blacks' family physician

to Mr. Drummond is inadmissible.

That is quite correct, your honor.

And I'm not asking for this letter
to be admitted into evidence.

I'm simply asking that this witness

be allowed to read the letter

under rule 612 of the
Tennessee rules of evidence.

612.

So her recollection can be refreshed.
That's all.

Mr. Baylor, what do you say?

I don't know, your honor.

I just object to this.

And also we were not furnished this letter

in pre-trial discovery.

What do you say to that, Mr. Drummond?

Your honor, I had no idea
this letter would be needed.

I expected this lady to tell the truth
about what her doctor told her.

Anything else, Mr. Baylor?

No.

Mr. Drummond, I'm gonna
give you a little latitude,

but don't stray too far.

Very well, your honor. Now, Mrs. Black,

does that letter refresh your recollection

as to whether or not
Donny Ray's leukemia

was the kind that could be helped
by a bone marrow transplant?

Well, see, now, he is not a specialist.

But he is a licensed,

experienced, capable physician

who lovingly told you time and time again

what you quite understandably
did not want to accept...

that your son was going to die of leukemia

despite the best efforts of medical science.

Is that not true?

But he wasn't a specialist.

I didn't believe him.

Not only did you not believe him, ma'am,

but you were less than truthful with me

and with this jury moments ago

when you told us under oath

that Dr. page never said that your son

had the type of leukemia
that could not be treated

by a bone marrow transplant.

I believe your exact words were...

"He never said that.

"Not like that

"to me."

He wasn't a specialist.

I just wanted Donny Ray

to have the best medical
treatment available.

You'd do the same thing.

Of course, ma'am.

Of course.

That'll be all.

You honor.

You may step down, Mrs. Black.

I didn't do very good, did I?

Oh, no, no, you did fine. You did fine.

It's all right. The jury can see
exactly what he's up to.

- The jury can see what he's up to.
- Don't worry about it.

- I need a smoke.
- I know you do.

We're gonna get to that later.

I hope he hasn't changed the locks.

Are you scared?

Yeah.

Let's do it.

What a pig!

I'm sorry.

Hurry, Kelly. Come on.

There's more of my stuff in the closet.

Hey, you can't take everything, Kelly.

Oh, no!

Hey! Hello!

I'm home!

Well, what do you know?

What do we have here?

What you two been doing in here, huh?

Hey, take it easy, all right?

Come on, tell me. I'm your husband.
Remember that, huh?

- Take it easy, Buddy.
- You shut up!

Hey, listen, Buddy, all right? Listen.

I ain't listening to nothing!

Take it easy. Take it...

You hurt me, baby.

You hurt me so bad!

Why are you doing this to me?!

No, Cliff!

Run!

Rudy! Rudy!

Cliff, you idiot, what are you doing?!

You see what you did?

- Kelly!
- You see what you did?

Is this what you wanted?

It's not my fault! I love you! I love you!

Rudy!

Stop it, Rudy!

Stop.

Give me the bat and leave.

What?

Give me the bat and leave.

You were not here tonight.

Give me the bat.

Go, Rudy.

You were not here tonight.

He's finally killed her.

No, it's him. He's dead.

- You sure?
- Just saw her.

- How'd it happen?
- I don't know, but...

They say when you commit a murder,

you make at least 25 mistakes,

and later you're lucky
if you remember 5 of 'em.

It was self-defense,

but I can't get past the fact that he's dead.

And the mistakes are piling up
in my mind so fast, I can't think.

This way, ma'am.

But Kelly knew.

She knew what to do.

She knew it was time.

With everything that was happening
and all that was at stake,

her first thought was for my safety.

And I left her in there all alone.

Damn it!

God damn you, Kelly!

What the hell's going on here?

What the hell did you do?

You killed my son!

God damn you!

Excuse me, I'm her lawyer.

I insist on being here
while she's being questioned.

This is your attorney?

Yes, sir.

I want her released to my custody.

I can't do that.

I don't know what kind of lawyer you are,

but we got a dead body here,

and bond needs to be set by a judge.

I'm going to jail?

Well, can we arrange for a private cell?

Look, asshole, I don't run the jail.

You got a better way of doing things,

then you need to talk to the jailer.

They love lawyers down there, right?

Look...

If your lawyer here is worth his salt,

you'll be out of here sometime tomorrow,
if you can post bond, okay?

Okay.

- You got 5.
- Thank you.

They're watching us
through that window there,

and this room is probably bugged,

so just be careful what you say.

What does "manslaughter" mean?

It's just murder without the element of intent.

How much time could I get?

No, no, no, you have to be convicted first.

I'm not gonna let that happen.

That's not gonna happen.

Cross your wrists
behind you please, ma'am.

This way, ma'am.

Mr. Lufkin...

you are the Vice President of Claims
at Great Benefit, are you not?

Yes, I am.

Approach the witness, your honor?

You may.

You recognize this?

Go on.

Read that to the jury.

"Dear Mrs. Black,

"on 7 prior occasions this company
has denied your claim in writing.

"We now deny it
for the eighth and final time.

"You must be stupid, stupid, stupid.

"Sincerely Everett Lufkin,

"Vice President, Claims."

That's you?

Yes.

How do you explain that?

It was a difficult time for me personally.

I was under a lot of stress.

We had denied this claim 7 times before.

I was trying to be emphatic.

I snapped.

I regret having written the letter,

and I apologize.

Don't you think it's a little late
for an apology?

Maybe.

Maybe?

The boy is dead, isn't he?

Yes.

Now, Mr. Lufkin,

who is Jackie Lemancyzk?

Jackie Lemancyzk
is a former claims handler.

And did she work in your department?

Yes.

And when did she stop
working for Great Benefit?

I don't remember the day.

How about October 30th?

Sounds close.

And wasn't that just two days
before she was scheduled

to give a deposition in this case?

I really don't remember.

I'd like to refresh the witness'
recollection under rule 612.

October 30th.

Apparently.

And that was just two days
before she was scheduled

to give a deposition in this matter?

I guess so.

And she was the person responsible

for handling Donny Ray Black's claim,

was she not?

That's correct.

And you fired her?

Of course not.

Well, how'd you get rid of her?

She resigned.

It's right here in the letter you just gave me.

Oh! Why'd she resign?

"I hereby resign for personal reasons."

So, it was her idea to leave her job?

That's what it says.

Nothing further.

You may step down, sir.

- Hello.
- Hi.

I'm Jackie Lemancyzk's brother James.

Is it possible to see her?

James Lemancyzk?

Yes.

One minute.

All rise.

Let me explain, Miss Lemancyzk.

I'm really not your brother.

Rudy. Good.

I'd like you to meet Jackie Lemancyzk.

This is Jackie Lemancyzk.

Where she goes, Carl goes.

This is my partner,

Rudy S. Baylor.

Just tell him what you told me.

Miss Lemancyzk.

It's a pleasure to meet you.

Is it all right if I sit down?

Sure, sure.

All right, Miss Lemancyzk,

let's talk about the Black file.

It was assigned to you?

Yes, that's correct.

The initial claim from Mrs. Black
was assigned to me.

Pursuant to company policy at the time,

I sent her a letter of denial.

Why?

Why?

Because all claims were initially denied.

All claims?

All claims.

Okay, this is how it works.

The policy...

is sold door to door

in the poorer neighborhoods.

Paid in cash

each week.

The claim comes in
and is assigned to a handler.

That's basically a low level paper pusher.

Anyway, the handler reviews it

and immediately sends
a letter to the insured

denying the claim.

The claims handler then

sends the file over to underwriting.

The underwriting sends a memo
back to claims saying...

"Don't pay this until you hear from us."

Now, what you should keep in mind

is that even though all these people
work for this big company,

and they all work in the same building,

they don't know each other.

Nor do they know
what the other department is up to.

Now, this is very intentional.

The departments are kept
at war with each other.

Now, meanwhile,

there's the client.

And they're getting all these letters.

Some from claims,
some from underwriting,

and most people give up.

And this, of course, is...

intended.

Your next witness, Mr. Baylor.

Plaintiff calls Jackie Lemancyzk.

What'd he say?

- Objection, your honor!
- We're right here, Miss Lemancyzk.

- Approach the bench?
- You may.

This is a complete surprise, your honor.

Why? She's listed as a potential witness.

We have a right to be forewarned.

When did you find her?

I didn't know she was lost.

It's a fair question, Mr. Baylor.

Well, it's my first trial.

That's not good enough.

It is a matter of fairness, your honor.

We have a right to be notified
about your witness.

I agree.

Are you telling me she can't testify?

She's listed in the pretrial order, your honor.

Pursuant to rule 26.06,

we have the right to call her as a witness.

Objection overruled.

Go memorize.

State your name for the record.

Jackie Lemancyzk.

Miss Lemancyzk, how long
did you work for Great Benefit?

6 years.

And when did your employment end?

October 30th.

How did it end?

I was fired.

You mean you did not resign?

No, I was fired.

Approach the witness, your honor?

You may.

I am baffled, Miss Lemancyzk,

because I have this letter here,

and it says that you quit
for personal reasons.

The letter is a lie.

I was fired so the company could
claim that I no longer worked there.

Can you please point out
the man in the courtroom

who made you write this letter?

Jack Underhall.

He told me I was leaving immediately,

and I had two choices...

I could call it a firing and leave with nothing,

or I could write that letter,

call it a resignation,

and the company would
give me $10,000 in cash

to keep quiet.

And I had to make that decision

right there in his presence.

Go on.

I took the cash...

and I also signed a letter
saying I would never discuss

any of my claims files with anybody.

Including the Black file?

Specifically the Black file.

So you knew that claim
should have been paid?

Everybody knew.

But the company was playing the odds.

What odds?

The odds that the insured
would not consult a lawyer.

Now, during that time...

you were a senior claims examiner?

Yes, that's correct.

And during that time,
was there ever an occasion

when you were given instructions

regarding how you should handle claims?

Deny all claims for a year.

Add up the money saved,

deduct the amount spent
on quick court settlements,

and there's a pot of gold left.

Approach the clerk, your honor?

- You may.
- Thank you.

Number 6, please.

Here's what has heretofore been
marked defense exhibit number 6.

Do you recognize this?

Yes. It's a Great Benefits
company claims manual.

Would you do me a favor

and just flip over to section "U", please?

There is no section "U".

But do you remember a section "U"

when you were a senior claims examiner?

Yes, I do.

Section "U" was an
executive memorandum

in the senior examiners manual.

Thank you.

Your honor,

this is Jackie Lemancyzk's
actual senior claims manual,

and within it, there is an executive
memorandum entitled section "U".

- I ask that I might approach this witness...
- Objection, your honor.

- ...so she may read from it.
- Approach the bench?

Your honor, we were not given
a complete manual by the defense.

Your honor, this document contains

executive memoranda
that are stolen work papers

and may not be admitted.

May not be admitted?

Can you prove this, Leo?

Your honor, I ask that you
instruct my colleague here

not to read from

nor to make reference to any suspect...

I don't understand
why this is not admissible.

It was not proffered at the correct time,

nor do we know how it was obtained.

- I just found out about this last night.
- Okay, okay.

Assuming that I can't get this in now,

do you have any more
questions for the witness?

No, your honor.

You may cross-examine, Mr. Drummond.

Thank you.

Is it true, Miss Lemancyzk...

that you have recently been committed

to an institution for various problems?

I was not committed.

I am suffering from
alcoholism and depression.

- I see.
- And I voluntarily checked into a facility.

I was supposed to be covered

by my group policy at Great Benefit,

and they, of course, are denying my claim.

Is that why you're here, Miss Lemancyzk?

Because you're angry with Great Benefit?

Miss Lemancyzk!

I hate Great Benefit

and most of the worms that work there.

Did you feel Mr. Lufkin was a worm

when you were sleeping with him?

Objection.

Your honor,

Mr. Drummond might
find this fun to talk about,

but this is not relevant at all.

Oh, there's no fun for me.

Overruled.

Let's see where this takes us.

You admit to having
an affair with Mr. Lufkin?

Miss Lemancyzk?

As long as I had sex
with certain executives

at Great Benefit,

my pay was increased,
and I was promoted.

When I stopped, I was demoted.

Miss Lemancyzk,

as an employee of Great Benefit,

you promised not to disclose

confidential private claims information.

- Yes?
- Yes.

In fact, you testified that
you sealed that promise

by demand of payment
for $10,000, didn't you?

That payment was not my idea.

But you accepted it, didn't you?

You put it right in your pocketbook.

Even though in your mind,

you never intended to keep that promise.

In fact, you were very angry

at Great Benefit and Mr. Lufkin, weren't you?

You know, they preyed on me,

because I was broke, and I was single,
and I had two kids.

So, you told him you're gonna go
to his wife, go to the newspapers.

And that $10,000, that was...
just a piece of blackmail, wasn't it?

A way to extort money
from the company you hated!

Isn't that right?

No, that's not true.

In fact, your testimony
here today is just a lie!

You stole company work papers,

confidential reports
as blackmail for revenge.

Hell hath no fury as what, Miss Lemancyzk?

A woman scorned!

Your honor, I move that all documents

provided the plaintiff
by Miss Jackie Lemancyzk

be deemed stolen work papers

and struck from these proceedings.

Based on the evidence
presently before the court,

these documents are inadmissible.

No further questions.

Thank you, Mr. Drummond.

- Mr. Baylor.
- Thank you, your honor.

You may step down, Miss Lemancyzk.

I'm sorry.

- Hello.
- Hi. This is Deck Schifflet.

I need to speak to big rhino.
Can you connect me?

Big rhino? Just a second.

Okay.

Hello?

Hey, boss, it's Deck.

Oh, hey, Deck, how're you doing?

Good. How are you?

Well, I'm cool.

Are you here?

Well, I'm here and there.

Ah, yeah, here and there.

Listen, I got a stolen-evidence situation.

Okay. Stolen evidence...

Let me see...

Okay. The De Soto case.

De Soto?

Carmine De Soto. You remember him?

- Club Ruby.
- Uh-huh.

Where... do I find that?

Around '92, you'll find it...

let's see, 650 something...

southwest second.

Boss, you're a lifesaver.

'92?

Yeah. Club Ruby case.

- '92...
- Carmine De Soto.

Carmine De Soto.

- Club Ruby.
- Club Ruby.

It's from the appellate court.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. It kind of rings a bell.

I got it! And from Bruiser, of all people.

Bruiser? I thought you didn't
know where Bruiser was.

Well, I don't. But I got an
emergency-contact number.

I call them, they get me in touch with him.

Look, Rudy,

nobody knows more than Bruiser
about stolen evidence.

You might say it's his stock and trade.

Hello?

- Mr. Rudy Baylor?
- Yes.

This is the Shelby county D.A.

Can you come to the courthouse tonight?

I'd like to discuss the Kelly Riker case.

- Sure.
- Come to room 6.

There's an advantage to dealing
with pimps and thieves.

In the case of Carmine De Soto
vs. The Club Ruby,

there are reams of stolen evidence.

Now, Bruiser worked on this stuff himself.

Not now. I got to go.

You got to go?

You got the CEO of Great Benefit
coming in tomorrow.

We... got to nail this guy. Come on!

Good luck, Kelly.

Thanks.

I met with the D.A.

She's not gonna prosecute.

Said she'd never get a conviction.

It was self-defense, Kelly.

The plaintiff would like to call
Wilfred Keeley to the stand.

Raise your right hand, please.

Do you solemnly swear that the testimony

you're about to give in this cause

will be the truth, the whole truth,

and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

- I do.
- You may take the stand.

State your name for the record.

Wilfred Keeley.

May I approach the witness, your honor?

You may.

Mr. Keeley, in this Great Benefit brochure,

is that you? Is that your name?

Yes.

And what do those initials stand for?

CEO?

Yeah. What do they stand for?
What does "CEO" mean?

Chief executive officer.

Chief executive officer.
Thank you, thank you.

So you're the... the guy.

You're the main guy, you're the cheese.

The buck stops with you.

- You could say that, yes.
- Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

Your honor, I'd like to turn the questioning

of Mr. Keeley over to my partner,
Rudy Baylor.

What, are you out of your mind?

- You don't have a license.
- I didn't have a choice.

What are you doing? You're late.

Good morning, your honor.

Sorry I'm late, sir.

Approach the witness, your honor?

You may.

This is the claims manual that was
given to me by Jackie Lemancyzk.

Objection, your honor.

Stolen work papers. Inadmissible.
You ruled on this.

Sustained.

May we approach?

I thought this matter was
already settled, your honor.

Your honor, I just this morning

found a case that is controlled

in this factual situation.

What do you have?

If you'll just take a look at this ruling.

It's Club Ruby vs. Carmine De Soto.

Copy for your honor
and one for Mr. Drummond.

Number 585, southwest second, page 431,

argued by Bruiser... by J. Lyman Stone.

And it shows very clearly

that stolen documents
are, in fact, admissible,

if the lawyers played no part in the theft.

Well, according to these head notes,

this case will overrule your objection.

Sorry, Leo.

Oh, I'm sure you are, your honor.

But note my strong objection.

Objection noted.

May I approach?

Do so.

Your honor, I'm sorry.

Excuse the interruption, Mr. Keeley.

We were about to talk about
the Great Benefit claims manual.

Is that a complete Great
Benefit claims manual, sir?

- Yes.
- Does it have a section "U"?

It has a section "U" in it.

Well, let's talk about
this mysterious section "U".

Why don't we explain it to the jury?

Take a look at it.

Just read paragraph 3.

"Claim handlers are directed
to deny all claims

"within 3 days of receipt of claim.

"No exceptions."

Now, how do you explain this section "U"?

Well, sometimes we get some frivolous

and fraudulent claims in our business,

and sometimes we have
to use this kind of language

to focus in on the legitimate

and more needy claims.

Mr. Keeley, do you honestly
expect this court

to believe that explanation?

Well, this chapter merely denotes

in-house processing guidelines.

In-house processing guidelines.

No, Mr. Keeley. No, it does not.

Section "U" does a lot more than that.

I don't think it does that, son.

Mr. Keeley, doesn't it explain precisely

how claims should be routed
and shuffled and rerouted,

anything to avoid payment?

I admit nothing.

Your honor, approach the witness?

You may.

Now, Mr. Keeley,

how many policies did
Great Benefit have in effect

in the year 1995?

I don't know.

Well, let's see.

Does the figure 98,000 sound
correct, give or take a few?

Maybe.

That could be right, yeah.

Thank you.

Now, of these policies,
how many claims were filed?

Well, I don't know that.

Does the figure of 11,400

sound correct to you, give or take a few?

That's about right.

But I'd have to verify it, of course.

I see. So the information that I want
is right there in that book?

Yes.

Can you tell the jury of the 11
some odd thousand claims filed,

how many were denied?

I don't think I could.
That would take more time.

You've had two months, Mr. Keeley.

Now answer the question.

Well, I...

I don't think...

"9,141."

11,462 filed.

9,141 denied.

Your honor...

I have yet another document.

This is a report from Great
Benefit's medical committee.

Request permission
under previous precedent

to present it to Mr. Keeley.

Same objection, your honor.

Overruled. Objection noted.

Thank you.

Mr. Keeley, that is a report

from Great Benefit's
own medical committee,

which you chaired.

Would you please read from line 18?

"Since bone-marrow transplants

"have become standard procedure,

"Great Benefit would be financially justified

"in investing in bone-marrow clinics."

Approach the witness, your honor?

You may.

Thank you.

There you go.

A little louder.

Objection, your honor. Repetitious.

Overruled.

I want the jury to hear this.

"Since bone-marrow transplants

"have become standard procedure,

"Great Benefit would be financially justified

"in investing in bone-marrow clinics."

Financially justified.

That's what it's all about
at Great Benefit, isn't it?

Tender the witness.

Mr. Drummond.

No questions. We rest on our objections.

You're excused, Mr. Keeley.

Thank you.

- Rudy!
- Hmm?

- Come on. Get up. Come on, it's time.
- What?

Let's go. Come on, come on!

What will giving a judgment
of $10 million accomplish?

All insurance company premiums
will spin out of reach,

and it will pave the way

for government-controlled health coverage.

Yours is a grave responsibility.

Be wise,

be careful,

and be just.

Be just.

Thank you, your honor.

Mr. Baylor, your rebuttal.

Thank you, your honor.

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

When I think of Donny Ray Black...

gasping for his last breath
of air and slowly dying...

I am disgusted with myself

and with the entire legal profession
that could not save him.

I don't even feel good enough
about myself as a lawyer

to make my own summation.

So I thought I'd... let Donny Ray do that.

It's exhibit 16.

I weigh 110 pounds.

11 months ago, I weighed 160.

The leukemia was detected
in plenty of time.

I was in the hospital being treated

when the doctors realized that
the only thing that could save my life

would be a bone-marrow transplant.

So, I got released from the hospital,

'cause my family couldn't afford to pay

- the bill for what they had recommended.
- Why?

- Great Benefit insurance denied our claim.
- Come on.

It's okay.

If I had had a bone-marrow transplant,

I would have had a 90% chance of living.

I hope that you are astonished

as I am,

at the lengths to which
a wealthy insurance company,

like the defendant,

will go to take money
from a low-income family

and then keep it

by denying a legitimate claim.

It's no wonder they spend
so much money on their lawyers

and their lobbyists and
their public relations machine

to convince us we need tort reform,

that we need to put an end
to punitive damages.

I'm asking you, the jury...

just...

do what you think is right

in your hearts.

If you don't punish Great Benefit,

you could be their next victim.

That's it.

Don't be nervous.

Has the jury reached a verdict?

Yes, we have, your honor.

Is it written on paper,

according to my instructions?

Yes, sir.

Please read the verdict.

"We, the jury, find for the plaintiff

"and award actual damages

"in the amount of $150,000."

"And we, the jury, find for the plaintiff

"and award punitive damages

"in the amount of $50 million."

All rise.

These people were trying to hide things

and were trying to get away
with something they were...

And they got caught at it.

Another remarkable part of the story,

the lead attorney on the case, Rudy Baylor,

was trying his first case.

That's a staggering verdict,

I think, by anybody's estimation.

It's certainly one of the largest...

Well, not bad for a yard boy.

Well, it wasn't that difficult, really.

We just had a... great jury is what we had,

and the facts just fell into place.

- $50 million in punitive damages.
- $50 million?

Yeah.

How much do you get?

You get right to the point, don't you?

I'm sorry. It's not what I meant.

I know you didn't.

We get one third,
but the money's not in the bank yet.

I'll see you later.

You gonna leave this girl all alone?

Not for long.

Rudy. Rudy.

I've decided I'm gonna put
your name in my will.

You know what? You are just
too kind to me, Miss Birdie.

Hot off the newswire.

"Mr. Wilfred Keeley,
CEO of Great Benefit,

"was detained yesterday afternoon at JFK

"just after boarding a flight
bound for Heathrow.

"Traveling with his wife,

"they claimed to be sneaking
away for a quick holiday.

"However, they could not produce
the name of a hotel anywhere in Europe..."

...at which they were expected.

At 5 p.m. today, insurance
company Great Benefit

filed for protection
under the bankruptcy code

in federal court in Cleveland.

Many states are now
investigating Great Benefit,

and a number of class-action
lawsuits have been filed.

For CNN, Jim Redmond reporting.

Hello?

Rudy, Leo Drummond here.

It appears the company's been looted.

I'm sorry, Rudy.

I wanted you to get
every penny of that money.

Everybody loses on this one.

Wanted you to know.

Thank you, Mr. Drummond.

Great Benefit's like a bad slot machine,

never pays off.

We should have taken 175,000.

What the hell were we thinking?

It just got all twisted, didn't it?

This legal profession.

Every lawyer in America
is talking about me right now.

But that doesn't exactly make me feel

like a member of the legal community.

I might be able to go on practicing law,

if I was working with my whole heart.

But I can't do that and cover Kelly.

And she's gonna need
a lot of cover for a while.

I still love the law. I'll always love it.

But maybe I should be teaching it

instead of practicing it out here in the world.

I need time to work it out.

Great Benefit has gone belly up.

Barring a miracle way off in the distance,

we won't get a dime.

God!

You've put them out of business, Dot.

One little woman from Memphis, Tennessee,

bankrupted them sons of bitches?

Oh!

I'm gonna go to Donny Ray's grave
tomorrow and tell him all about it.

So, I guess Kelly and I will be
taking off first thing in the morning.

We made history, Rudy.

You know that?

We can always brag.

Bye.

There's no doubt about it. I'm hot.

In fact, I'm so hot after this case,

there's no place for me to go but down.

See ya.

Every client I ever have will expect this.

The same magic, nothing less.

And I could probably give it to them,

if it didn't matter how I did it.

And then one morning,

I'd wake up and find that
I'd become Leo Drummond.

Now, you give me a call
when you pass the bar exam.

Yeah, piece of cake!

Every lawyer, at least once in every case,

feels himself crossing a line
he doesn't really mean to cross.

It just happens.

And if you cross it enough times,

it disappears forever.

And then you're nothing
but another lawyer joke,

just another shark in the dirty water.
