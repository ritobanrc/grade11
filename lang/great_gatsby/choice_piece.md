## Woman Run Over by Car near Long Island

Earlier this night, Mrs. Myrtle Wilson was run over by a yellow Rolls-Royce after she ran out into the road. The perpetrator appears to have fled the scene. Mrs. Wilson's husband, Mr. George Wilson, owns a garage on the large road. On the night of her death, Mr. Wilson told the Times, after seeing the yellow car, ran out appearing to meet it. The car, seemingly unable or unwilling to stop, ran over Myrtle, instantly killing her. 

The death comes after a long series of vicissitudes in this region between Long Island and New York City. Last year, we saw a series of farm closures, and the remainder are heavily dilapidated and appear neglected. Indeed, the accident occurred very near the infamous billboard featuring the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleberg. The Rolls-Royce appears to have been heading toward the long island neighborhoods of East and West Egg, home to the illustrious and eccentric Mr. Jay Gatsby, as well as the well-respected Mr. Tom Buchanan. 

Shortly after the incident, Mr. Buchanan arrived at the scene, and being a close friend of the Wilson's, appeared quite distraught. Mr. Buchanan told the Times that the yellow Rolls-Royce was the property of the aforementioned Mr. Jay Gatsby, although the Times cannot independently fact check this assertion. 

Additionally, the Times spoke to Mr. George Wilson, who claimed that Mr. Gatsby was responsible, though was unable to provide definitive evidence. Mr. Wilson also suggested during the conversation that Mr. Buchanan was having an affair with his wife, also without evidence. 

Regardless of the speculation and controversy surrounding the incident, this is a tragedy. A beautiful life has been lost. The funeral will be held on September 15. Our thoughts and prayers are with the deceased, and may she rest in peace.

## Wealth Inequality is Destroying America

And it's only getting worse. 

OPINION -- "All men are created equal". With these words, our country was founded. All men are entitled to "life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness". Any man can climb up from utter destitution and grow up to own a mansion. It's the classic rags-to riches story. We all love it. 

And yet, today, in the political climate of today, with the Russian Revolution, the SDP and KDP growing in power, all discussion of inequality seems to end with being called a communist. This is ludicrous. The worsening of wealth inequality is as harmful to the ideal of social mobility as any communist.

As the wealthy use their connections, their free ride scholarships to Ivy League universities, zoom through the working class neighborhoods in their luxury cars, between their giant mansions on Long Island and Wall Street in Manhattan, use their connections to outcompete small businesses, it's becoming increasingly impossible for a independent business to grow. 

Prohibition has only made this worse. What started out as a good faith effort to reform drinking habits and improve society has turned into a vessel for the wealthy to use their connections to illicitly distribute alcohol, literally sedating the working class of society, neglecting them and leaving them to rot. 

Critics will argue that ample opportunity exists for those that merely wish to seek it. While this is true to an extent, the development of electricity opened up a booming new industry for several decades, with hundreds finding their fortunes, and the Great War provided yet more opportunities for aspiring young men, the fundamental issue with these inequalities is not resolved. The rich and the powerful still hold an disproportionate amount of political power, they still use their connections to barricade up and coming businesses, they still have more opportunities than the rest of us. The problems with the system haven't gone away. 

If we want to preserve our ideal of social mobility, of the American dream, and the independent small farmer who works their way up from nothing, we can't have robber barons, dragons sitting on piles of gold, with more money than they could use in tens of generations and hundreds of years, in a functioning democracy. If all men are truly create equal, then we can't have some flying through life while everyone else trudges through it.
