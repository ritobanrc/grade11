# 1. The Matthew Effect

Again, a lot of performative bullshit that has nothing to do with the point he's trying to make. In fact, I'm beginning to suspect that he's making some of this up. He wasn't there at the time, so how does he know that what the air smelt like? 

> The air was filled with cigar smoke and the smell of champagne and sweat-soaked hockey gear.

Ok he steelmans the idea that hockey is a meritocracy

> In Outliers, I want to convince you that these kinds of personal explanations of success don’t work. People don’t rise from nothing. We do owe something to parentage and patronage. The people who stand before kings may look like they did it all by themselves. But in fact they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. 

TRU!!

And yet another completely unrelated analogy that he uses to build up ethos, this time, it's comparing the surroundings of a plant to the surroundings of people. The analogy works better than his previous one, but again, anyone that actually knows anything about ecology would balk at his misuse of the word. 

Based on this, I'd conclude that his thesis is something along the lines of "**The surroundings and context of a person's upbringing are a signficant contributor to success, moreso than individual effort.**".

> “In all my years in psychology, I have never run into an effect this large,” Barnsley says. “You don’t even need to do any statistical analysis. You just look at it.”

THIS ONE SENTENCE THAT SCIENTISTS DON'T WANT YOU TO HEAR!! HOW TO DESTROY YOUR CREDIBILITY IN ONE STEP!!!

holy shit this makes it so obvious that his target audience is people who don't know anything about science. This is what I hear from homeopathy supporters. lmao the next sentence says it's 17/25. That's still statistically significant, but it's pretty fucking far from being big enough for eyeball statistics. 

And again, in the footnote, everyone knows what a "self-fulfilling prophecy" is, but Gladwell cites some random-ass person to build up ethos.

And again, Gladwell makes it really obvious that his target audience isn't actual scientists or people who know statistics, by clarifying "12 to 14 percentile points" with the utterly meaningless phrase "huge effect".

> Because we cling to the idea that success is a simple function of individual merit and that the world in which we all grow up and the rules we choose to write as a society don’t matter at all.

Ok I can get behind this -- though I can't help but notice that we started this talking about things like how wealth and power disproportionally allow people like the Bush family to propagate their success, but we've shifted to talking about cutoff dates.
