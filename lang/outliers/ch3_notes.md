# 3. The Trouble with Geniuses, Part 1

> “He did math for an hour,” his brother Mark says of Langan’s summer routine in high school. “Then he did French for an hour. Then he studied Russian. Then he would read philosophy. He did that religiously, every day.”

Yeah, cause family members have never been known to be hyperbolic about the qualities of another. 

> Terman wrote his recruits letters of recommen-dation for jobs and graduate school applications. He doled out a constant stream of advice and counsel, all the time recording his findings in thick red volumes entitled Genetic Studies of Genius.

[3] Yeah, that won't fuck up the data at all! 

> **What Hudson is saying is that IQ is a lot like height in basketball.** Does someone who is five foot six have a realistic chance of playing professional basketball? Not really. You need to be at least six foot or six one to play at that level, and, all things being equal, it’s probably better to be six two than six one, and better to be six three than six two. But past a certain point, height stops mattering so much. A player who is six foot eight is not automatically better than someone two inches shorter. (Michael Jordan, the greatest player ever, was six six after all.) A basketball player only has to be tall enough—and the same is true of intelligence. **Intelligence has a threshold.**

Gladwell condescendingly explains a bizarre and totally unrelated analogy. Maybe he thinks his audience doesn't understand statistics when they are explained by a scientist, but even they, he only needs to last sentence. The long diatribe is just there to give the impression that Gladwell knows what he's talking about, that he's thought about it.

> “I think our expectation was that we would find a half- or two-thirds-full glass, that they had not done as well as the white students but nonetheless a lot were quite successful. But we were completely surprised. We found that they were doing every bit as well. There was no place we saw any serious discrepancy.”

TRUE! Though Gladwell's concept of a threshold is kidna missing the point -- the reason the black students did just as well is because they went to the same school as the white students. They got the same education, went to the same classes, were expected to meet the same standards, and so they did. Gladwell doesn't provide any evidence to directly support his conclusion, he just vaguely assumes its true cause the situations look kinda similar.

[5] Great, Gladwell is finally talking about different kinds of intelligence. Let's see what conclusions he arrives at from here.

> In a devastating critique, the sociologist Pitirim Sorokin once showed that if Terman had simply put together a randomly selected group of children from the same kinds of family backgrounds as the Termites—and dispensed with IQs altogether—he would have ended up with a group doing almost as many impressive things as his painstakingly selected group of geniuses

Once again, Gladwell demonstrates his completely unfamiliarity (or assumed unfamiliarity of his audience) with even basic science and statistical techniques. All this is saying is that Terman's results aren't statistically significant. But Gladwell has to act like it's "devastating" and novel.
