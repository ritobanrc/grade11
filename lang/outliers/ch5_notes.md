# 5. The Three Lessons of Joe Flom

> Brilliant immigrant kid overcomes poverty and the Depression, can’t get a job at the stuffy downtown law firms, makes it on his own through sheer hustle and ability. It’s a rags-to-riches story, and everything we’ve learned so far from hockey players and software billionaires and the Termites suggests that success doesn’t happen that way. Successful people don’t do it alone. Where they come from matters. They’re products of particular places and environments.

[1] Great! I can't help but notice something about being Jewish on the next page, but this looks really promising. It's a recognition that rags to riches isn't the norm. Of course, I'd prefer if Gladwell provided statistics, cause you can always find anecdotes, but whatever. 

[3] "The Importance of Being Jewish"? I really hope this doesn't turn out to be JQ shit.

And he has the audacity to call lawyers "conservative grey suits" right after dog-whistling neo-Nazi propaganda. 

> But as is so often the case with outliers, buried in that setback was a golden opportunity.

I feel like at this point, Gladwell is just collecting stories. They don't even form a coherent narrative. Like he says, to be successful, you must be

- Born in the right month
- At the right time
- Be wealthy
- Be well connected
- Be Jewish?

Wait he literally didn't even make an argument about the Jewish thing??? Was that literally just a dogwhistle?

So somehow right after saying "rags to riches stories don't exist", he describes a literal rags to riches story with no pushback. He really is a grifter, he was like "I'm talking about class issues to much, its gonna alienate the conservatives. Let's throw some Nazi dogwhistles in there to placate them, and I'll let the conservatives continue to believe that the free market is working just fine with this story."

Wait this is literally basic history. There were waves of immigration, and the Jewish immigrants often worked in textiles, because that's what they were familiar with and could do cheaply enough with the invention of the portable sewing machine. I could read this out of a history book. Why does Gladwell act like its a giant fucking revelation?
