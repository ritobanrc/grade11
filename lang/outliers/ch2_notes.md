# 2. The 10,000 Hour Rule

> It would be easier to accept that version of events, however, if we hadn’t just looked at hockey and soccer players. Theirs was supposed to be a pure meritocracy as well. Only it wasn’t. It was a story of how the outliers in a particular field reached their lofty status through a combination of ability, opportunity, and **utterly arbitrary** advantage.

Great! So I assume you're going to talk about how you'd have to be _extremely_ rich in 1971 to go to a school that had a computer lab, or how connected you'd have to be to get a job with a CS professor as a high school student.

[2] And then, Gladwell randomly pivots to talking about talent. Ok? 

> And what’s more, the people at the very top don’t work just harder or even much harder than everyone else. They work much, much harder.

I really hope he's not going to draw some... questionable... conclusions about the nature meritocracy today. He literally just spent an entire chapter detailing that being born in the right month _prerequisited_ becoming great.

And then, from two data points, in the same field, Gladwell picks a number out of thin air!

> But to Ericsson and those who argue against the primacy of talent, that isn’t surprising at all.

Really neat rhetorical trick from Gladwell there. He hasn't quoted Ericsson even once in this chapter. But he's managed to frame the book as a benign discussion between him and a respected scientist, where he's being a "harsh interviewer" asking "challenging questions", but that's not what's happening at all.

> You have to have parents who encourage and support you. You can’t be poor, because if you have to hold down a part-time job on the side to help make ends meet, there won’t be time left in the day to practice enough. In fact, most people can reach that number only if they get into some kind of special program—like a hockey all-star squad—or if they get some kind of extraordinary opportunity that gives them a chance to put in those hours.

Well that sounds like a pretty big fucking thing to put off until the last paragraph in this section.

[3] Again, Gladwell goes off on a completely unrelated tangent, this time about the history of computer, simply to give the impression that he's done his research. None of this has any bearing on the actual argument being made here.

> Add in the summers, then the days and nights in his first year at Berkeley. “So, so maybe… ten thousand hours?” he said, finally. “That’s about right.”

Neat trick here -- Gladwell again presents the impression that his conclusion is just naturally arrived at by the interviee, which I _guarantee_ didn't happen. Why would you phrase it as "That's about right." otherwise?

> If we scratch below the surface of every great achiever, do we always find the equivalent of the Michigan Computer Center or the hockey all-star team—some sort of special opportunity for practice?

> And what was so special about Hamburg? It wasn’t that it paid well. It didn’t. Or that the acoustics were fantastic. They weren’t. Or that the audiences were savvy and appreciative. They were anything but. It was the sheer amount of time the band was forced to play.

[4] Gladwell builds up the aesthetic of science here, without actually doing it. He makes a show of looking at multiple data points, but at the end of the day, he's just picking random data points that happen to support his claim.

> Joy and Gates and the Beatles are all undeniably talented. Lennon and McCartney had a musical gift of the sort that comes along once in a generation, and Bill Joy, let us not forget, had a mind so quick that he was able to make up a complicated algorithm on the fly that left his professors in awe

Wait I thought Gladwell literally just argued against the existence of talent. 

[6] Ok this part of the thesis I can accept. Being born at the right time to take advantage of significant innovations is useful. 

> There is an easy way to test this theory. When was Bill Gates born?

NOOOO!!! Aesthetics of science again! You can't test hypothesis with only positive results!
