# 7. The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes

What the actual fuck. This is already smelling like the "jews" of part 2.

And again, just random quotes and stuff, that anyone with a cursory knowledge of standard pilot jargon would know, but it builds up ethos. Or maybe he just copied them from the transcripts. Either way, it literally just builds up ethos.

[2] OH god is he going to say something dumb like "look at all these plane crashes in Korea with some super dog-whistly rhetoric?"

OH MY GOD SOME STATISTICS FOR THE FIRST GODDAMN TIME IN THE BOOK!!!!!! They might literally be "13/50" quality, but at least they're statistics. I assume he's just going to take the most obvious conclusion, but whatever

So many long winded anecdotes which are literally just dramatizations of the facts, without making a single goddamn point.

Oh fuck no I can see where this is going. He's gonna say that Korean society is more hierarchical and that's why the planes crashed. Even though he made a point of saying the "PDI" metric has nothing to do with cultural superiority, there is _definitely_ an undertone of American superiority here -- individualism is good, and 'Murica is the most resistant to hierarchy! Never mind the little capitalism thingy.

> The National Transportation Safety Board, the US agency responsible for investigating plane crashes, is headquartered in a squat, seventies-era office building on the banks of the Potomac River in Washington, 

Yay wikipedia level knowledge used to create ethos

And now he's talking about being tired? This has nothing to do with his larger thesis of culture? 

Why "WESTERN?" You literally just interviewed an effing Sri Lankan? So why are you dog whistling "western communication" as superior?
