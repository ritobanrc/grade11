# Introduction. The Rosety Mystery
- Gladwell begins by detailing the history of the city of Roseto. This has no bearing on his argument, it's literally just to build ethos [1]. 

> They counted twenty-two separate civic organizations in a town of just under two thousand people. They picked up on the particular egalitarian ethos of the community, which discouraged the wealthy from flaunting their success and helped the unsuccessful obscure their failures.

Whoah it's almost like mutual aid is effective!!

Wow -- off to a terrible start. Gladwell begins with an anecdote that has literally nothing to do with anything. He's literally just like "look it's an outlier!! I'm gonna talk about outliers."

Wolf and Bruhn's conclusion is literally just "stress really increases heart attacks, and community decreases stress". Gladwell is trying to paint this as some kind of ridiculous revolution, where no one had ever realized that having a supportive community completely solves everything -- which is just patently not true.
