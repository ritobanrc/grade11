# 8. Rice Paddies and Math Tests

> The countryside becomes breathtakingly beautiful, rolling hills dotted with outcroppings of limestone rock against the backdrop of the Nan Ling Mountains. Here and there are the traditional khaki-colored mud-brick huts of the Chinese peasantry.

Building ethos by giving the impression that Gladwell has been there.

> It dictated almost every working moment of every day. “Rice is life,” says the anthropologist Gonçalo Santos, who has studied a traditional South Chinese village. “Without rice, you don’t survive. If you want to be anyone in this part of China, you would have to have rice. It made the world go around.”

Yay! Stereotypes! Just generalize an entire country the size of the continent of Europe based on 3 words from a Portugese anthropologist!

HOLY FUCKING SHIT! Yeah Gladwell, just ignore the _massive_ socioeconomic disparity, the well documented effect of American immigration policies, the vast culturual effects of Asian countries being decimated by western colonialism leading to a cutthroat culture, yeah! It's cause Chinese numbers are shorter

> Historically, Western agriculture is “mechanically” oriented. In the West, if a farmer wanted to become more efficient or increase his yield, he introduced more and more sophisticated equipment, which allowed him to replace human labor with mechanical labor: a threshing machine, a hay baler, a combine harvester, a tractor. He cleared another field and increased his acreage, because now his machinery allowed him to work more land with the same amount of effort. But in Japan or China, farmers didn’t have the money to buy equipment—and, in any case, there certainly wasn’t any extra land that could easily be converted into new fields. So rice farmers improved their yields by becoming smarter, by being better managers of their own time, and by making better choices. 

History can be whatever I want it to be! Holy shit this is literally just bullshit

Yes! European farmers didn't repair their equipment in their fields! That's why 

> But China and Japan never developed that kind of oppressive feudal system, because feudalism simply can’t work in a rice economy

YEAH CAUSE JAPAN NEVER HAD FEUDALISM

“No food without blood and sweat.” \ “Farmers are busy; farmers are busy; if farmers weren’t busy, where would grain to get through the winter come from?” \ “In winter, the lazy man freezes to death.” \ “Don’t depend on heaven for food, but on your own two hands carrying the load.” \ “Useless to ask about the crops, it all depends on hard work and fertilizer.” \ “If a man works hard, the land will not be lazy.”

Yeah cause no other culture has ever developed proverbs about hard work

Hey the first fucking truthful statement in teh book -- he didn't remember how to calculate the slope of a line.

And just fucking wonderful, drawing conclusions from 1 experiment of 1 person figuring out middle school algebra.

And somehow, he essentializes this characteristic of "experimentation"
