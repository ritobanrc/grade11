# 3. The Trouble with Geniuses, Part 2

> Jack Langan would go on drinking sprees and disappear. He would lock the kitchen cabinets so the boys couldn’t get to the food. He used a bullwhip to keep the boys in line. He would get jobs and then lose them, moving the family on to the next town. One summer the family lived on an Indian reservation in a teepee, subsisting on government-surplus peanut butter and cornmeal. For a time, they lived in Virginia City, Nevada. “There was only one law officer in town, and when the Hell’s Angels came to town, he would crouch down in the back of his office,” Mark Langan remembers. “There was a bar there, I’ll always remember. It was called the Bucket of Blood Saloon.”

[1] And again, way too many irrelevant details that Gladwell couldn't possibly know, just to build ethos. 

> What? One of the main reasons college professors accept a lower paycheck than they could get in private industry is that university life gives them the freedom to do what they want to do and what they feel is right. Langan has Harvard backwards.

[2] What on Earth is Gladwell talking about? So far, this entire chapter has been entirely incoherent.

> There were only two parenting “philosophies,” and they divided almost perfectly along class lines. The wealthier parents raised their kids one way, and the poorer parents raised their kids another way. / The wealthier parents were heavily involved in their children’s free time, shuttling them from one activity to the next, quizzing them about their teachers and coaches and teammates. One of the well-off children Lareau followed played on a baseball team, two soccer teams, a swim team, and a basketball team in the summer, as well as playing in an orchestra and taking piano lessons.

[3] This is true, it's also quite interesting...

> When we talk about the advantages of class, Lareau argues, this is in large part what we mean. Alex Williams is better off than Katie Brindle because he’s wealthier and because he goes to a better school, but also because—and perhaps this is even more critical—the sense of entitlement that he has been taught is an attitude perfectly suited to succeeding in the modern world.

I can't really say whether "being more capable of telling the doctor about something" is the _defining_ characteristic of class differences, but I'll accept that the tendency is certainly there. And more generally, people of higher class have better connections, and are able to utilize those better, so I suppose the impact definitely exists.

[4] And once again, random, unrelated details about Oppenheimer's childhood to build ethos, and then Gladwell barely even has to try to convince you of his point.

> They were true outliers.

Really? The C group, which had over 20 people, were the outliers. 

[6] This just seems insensitive. Gladwell finds that Lagan is content, he's literally reading a book from a leftist, the obvious implication being that he isn't interested in the cuthroat competition that Gladwell wants, but he's forced to squeeze it into his narrative, so despite no evidence, says that "Lagan failed". 

Overall, this chapter was better than the other ones. At least he finally acknowledges that class plays a role in success, though it comes way to late, and qualified by way too much. And it seems literally every single study, the way Gladwell phrases it anyway, has perfect results, which obviously didn't happen. They just had extremely low P-values. Whatever, it's obvious enough that this isn't targeted at people who know statistics.
