# 9. Marita's Bargain

Ok I can probably agree with the thesis here. It's still 1 data point, but it is definitely true that if you put people in an environment where they have more oppurtunity, they will do well.

Yeah so here he's doing the thing where he says something obvious and acts like its profound. It's literally just "kids forget things over summer". But by treating this as if it's the magic bullet solution to education, he completely misses, for example, the preponderance of evidence that says that kids function better with 9 hours of sleep!
