# 6. Harlan, Kentucky

> The Cumberland Plateau is a wild and mountainous region of flat-topped ridges, ... one thick seam after another of coal.

Again, wikipedia level knowledge, but it just builds up ethos.

What the hell is his point here?

> As the young men tried to squeeze by, the confederate looked up, annoyed. He slammed the filing cabinet drawer shut, jostled the young men with his shoulder, and, in a low but audible voice, said the trigger word: “Asshole.”

And once again, Gladwell is about to draw an overly large claim from an overly specific data point. He has no reason to believe that this experiment has _anything_ to do with the culture of honor he was just describing, I don't see that mentioned by the authors of the study anywhere. He's literally just making up conclusions.

> The results were unequivocal

That's not a p-value.

> “We even played this game of chicken,” Cohen said. “We sent the students back down the hallways, and around the corner comes another confederate. The hallway is blocked, so there’s only room for one of them to pass. The guy we used was six three, two hundred fifty pounds. He used to play college football. He was now working as a bouncer in a college bar. He was walking down the hall in business mode—the way you walk through a bar when you are trying to break up a fight. The question was: how close do they get to the bouncer before they get out of the way? And believe me, they always get out of the way.”

And that's just bad experimental design. This whole thing is bullshit.

> So far in Outliers we’ve seen that success arises out of the steady accumulation of advantages: when and where you are born, what your parents did for a living, and what the circumstances of your upbringing were all make a significant difference in how well you do in the world

Ok that's a valid claim. But I feel like he's doing the Jordan Peterson thing here, where he gives you a statement so unequivocally true, then vaguely gestures you towards a pathway that might not be, giving him the plausible deniability.
