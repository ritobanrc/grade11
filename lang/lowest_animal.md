# The Lowest Animal

* Rhetorical Elements = Rhetorical devices
    - How do they work together to create the satire?
* What was his purpose in writing _The Lowest Animal_? 
    - To critique the worst aspects of human nature
    - To point out hypocrisy
    - To satirize the idea of man being superior to other animals

## Rhetorical analysis
>  I have been scientifically studying the traits and dispositions of the "lower animals" **(so-called)**, and contrasting them with the traits and dispositions of man. I find the result **humiliating** to me. For it obliges me to renounce my allegiance to the Darwinian theory of the Ascent of Man from the Lower Animals; since it now seems plain to me that the theory ought to be vacated in favor of a new and truer one, this new and truer one to be named the **Descent of Man from the Higher Animals**. 

* Saying "so-called" sounds sarcastic
    - So-called makes him sound derisive to the idea of "lower animals"
    - Using parenthesis breaks the pace
* "Humiliating" sounds like an exaggeration
    - Makes it sound like a bigger issue that it is, gives the reader a clearer idea of how bad it is
    - Is a lot stronger than, say, embarrassing
* Descent of Man from the Higher Animals
    - It's an inversion -- the traditional archetype is that animals became better, higher, and then became man, but Twain is inverting that and making it the Descent of man, which is the opposite of what we expect
* Twain's purpose is to entertain, not to inform. This is apparent from the hyperbole and sarcasm in "so-called" and "humiliating". Additionally, phrases like "renounce my allegiance" make it obvious that this isn't an actual scientific article; no one holds "allegiance" to scientific theories. But the word choice, "scientifically", "traits", "dispositions", "vacated", give a faux formal scientific air. But by using hyperbole, and by inverting the Darwinian theory, Twain makes it clear that he's satirizing, not seriously arguing scientifically,  satirizes the societal perception that man has evolved to be a higher animal than the rest.

> 1. **That the** human race is of one distinct species. It exhibits slight variations—in color, stature, mental caliber, and so on—due to climate, environment, and so forth; but it is a species by itself and not to be confounded with any other.
> 2. **That the** quadrupeds are a distinct family, also. This family exhibits variations—in color, size, food preferences, and so on; but it is a family by itself.  
> 3. **That the** other families—the birds, the fishes, the insects, the reptiles, etc.—are more or less distinct, also. They are in the procession. They are links in the chain which stretches down from the higher animals to man at the bottom.

* Anaphora, repeating "That the" at the beginning of each paragraph, emphasizes the "findings" he presents. The numbered structure makes it appear scientific, and beginning with "That the" makes him sound objective. But then, he subverts that by creating the image of a "procession", which "stretches" down to "man at the bottom". The anaphora builds up a pattern, and then Twain ends it when a big reveal with his main thesis.

>  I was aware that many men who have accumulated more millions of money than they can ever use have shown a rabid hunger for more, and have not scrupled to cheat the ignorant and the helpless out of their poor servings in order to partially appease that appetite. **I furnished a hundred different kinds of wild and tame animals the opportunity to accumulate vast stores of food, but none of them would do it. The squirrels and bees and certain birds made accumulations, but stopped when they had gathered a winter's supply, and could not be persuaded to add to it either honestly or by chicane.** **In order to bolster up a tottering reputation the ant pretended to store up supplies, but I was not de­ceived. I know the ant.** These experiments convinced me that there is this difference between man and the higher animals: he is avaricious and miserly; they are not. 

* Things that should not be taken literally
    - Twain definitely does not know the "ant", but the absurdity of it makes humans feel dirty -- we're even more greedy and avaricious than ants.
    - He personifies and exaggerates the qualities of the ants, giving them human-like behaviors. This emphasizes the point, making us seem meaner than the ants.
    - He didn't literally get hundreds of animals "vast stores of food", and we're not supposed to literally believe that animals are responsible enough to stop collecting food when they have enough, but it sounds plausible enough that it makes us realize that, in general, animals only take what they need, which reveals the fact that humans are unique in taking things we don't need

* What is the tone in the first few paragraphs of the essay?
    - At first, at least superficially, the tone appears to be serious and scientific, but with enough mockery peppered throughout to make it clear that he's being satirical.

>  **Indecency, vulgarity, obscenity** (these are strictly confined to man); he invented them. Among the higher animals there is no trace of them. They hide nothing; **they are not ashamed**. Man, with his **soiled mind**, covers himself. He will not even enter a drawing room with his breast and back naked, so alive are he and his mates to indecent suggestion. Man is The Animal that Laughs. But **so does the monkey**, as Mr. Darwin pointed out; and so does the **Australian bird that is called the laughing jackass**. No! **Man is the Animal that Blushes**. He is the only one that does it or has occasion to. 

| Humans                | Animals                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Indecency             | Unashamed                     |
| Vulgarity             | Free to do whatever they want
| Obscenity             |
| Soiled mind           | Unsoiled, pure                |
| "Animal that Blushes" | All Animals Laugh             |

* How does Twain's dictions reveal his attitude toward higher animals and humans? What's he saying about humans, and what's he implying about animals?
    - Twain argues that other animals are free, unencumbered by ideas of decency or propriety, while humans have invented those issues. While animals are "unashamed", humans are concerned with "indecency", even in exceedingly silly situations. While humans are concerned with "vulgarity", Twain implies that animals are free to do as they wish. Finally, he suggests humans are the "Animal that Blushes", suggesting our obsession with propriety and civilization is unique, while the higher animals are the ones truly free to "laugh".
* Tone: the tone is getting darker, more openly critical of humans

>  The higher animals engage in individual fights, but never in organized masses. **Man is the only** animal that deals in that atrocity of atrocities, War. **He is the only** one that gathers his brethren about him and goes forth in cold blood and with calm pulse to exterminate his kind. **He is the only animal** that for sordid wages will march out, as the Hessians did in our Revolution, and as the boyish Prince Napoleon did in the Zulu war, and help to slaughter strangers of his own species who have done him no harm and with whom he has no quarrel. 

* This almost becomes an invective, broadly and unilaterally criticizing man, and giving up the veneer of scientific playfulness. Twain uses anaphora, repeating "He is the only", cataloguing each horrible aspect of man. Words like "cold blood" and "calm pulse", "exterminate his kind" to emphasize the horrifying aspects of war. He concludes with a scathing condemnation of war, suggesting that it causes man harm to others "with whom he has no quarrel". This is openly a social criticism at this point, no longer a scientific treatise. 
* Allusions to the "Hessians", and the "boyish Prince Napoleon" bring back imagery of the war, reminding the reader that this so far quite absurd piece is actually grounded in reality. Additionally, the word "boyish" emphasized the capricious nature of the way humans carry out war.

>  Man is the Religious Animal. **He is the only** Religious Animal. **He is the only animal** that has the True Religion – several of them. **He is the only animal** that loves his neighbor as himself, and cuts his throat if his theology isn't straight. He has made a graveyard of the globe in trying his honest best to smooth his brother's path to happiness and heaven. He was at it in the time of the Caesars, he was at it in Mahomet's time, he was at it in the time of the Inquisition, he was at it in France a couple of centuries, he was at it in England in Mary's day, he has been at it ever since he first saw the light, he is at it today in Crete (as per the telegrams quoted above), he will be at it somewhere else tomorrow. The higher animals have no religion. And we are told that they are going to be left out, in the Hereafter. I wonder why? It seems questionable taste. 

* Twain contains the anaphora of "He is the only", this time referring to religion. He capitalises Religious Animal, and True Religion, subtly mocking the ways some religions capitalize God or the Pope. Then, he moves onto the straightforward criticism of crusades, using imagery, "a graveyard of the globe" to allow the reader to visualize the extent of the harm. Then, he catalogues several allusions to wars of religion, mentioning Caesar, Mohammad, the Spanish Inquisition, the French Wars of Religion, England in under Queen Mary. Finally, at the very end, he ties it back to the idea of animals, where he includes one line, "[they] have no religion". At this point, the tone is very clearly critical of man, cataloguing man's worst attributes, though he shies back to the playful scientific query at the very end.

>  In truth, man is **incurably foolish**. Simple things which the other animals easily learn, he is incapable of learning. Among my experiments was this. In an hour I taught a cat and a dog to be friends. I put them in a cage. In another hour I taught them to be friends with a rabbit. In the course of two days I was able to add a fox, a goose, a squirrel and some doves. Finally a monkey. They lived together in peace; even affectionately.

> Next, in another cage I confined an Irish Catholic from Tipperary, and as soon as he seemed tame I added a Scotch Presbyterian from Aberdeen. Next a Turk from Constantinople; a Greek Christian from Crete; an Armenian; a Methodist from the wilds of Arkansas; a Buddhist from China; a **Brahman from Benares**. Finally, a **Salvation Army Colonel from Wapping**. Then I stayed away two whole days. When I came back to note results, the cage of Higher Animals was all right, but in the other there was but a **chaos of gory odds and ends of turbans and fezzes** and plaids and bones – not a specimen left alive. These Reasoning Animals had disagreed on a theological detail and carried the matter to a Higher Court. 

* Twain returns to his more playful scientific tone here, beginning with "incurably foolish" and recounting a supposed experiment. He contrasts how a group of animals of different species were able to live together "in peace", while humans murder each other over superficial differences of religion. He makes several allusions to details about the religion, even looking up the correct term for a Hindu priest (sorta, it's complicated), and one of the Hindu holy cities (Benares), and including details the result of "gory odds and ends", mentioning specific "turbans" and "fezzes", allowing the reader to visualize this experiment, and almost giving him some credibility, to make it sound like he actually did the experiment. While the actual experiment is absurd, Twain uses that absurdity to make a point about the extent of our theological infighting.
