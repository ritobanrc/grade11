    Questions inspired by the chapter (What might you ask a text? Want to discuss further?)

# Introduction: How'd he do That?
* Thesis: Literature has a set of conventions, patterns, and symbols, which an experienced reader can pick out to draw connections and understand a story better.
* Summary: Foster begins by presenting a story, which he claims involves a bargain with the devil. Then, he discusses the concept of a literary grammar or language of reading, and argues that a reader can develop their ability to recognize the patterns and symbols in the literary grammar through practice, by expanding what they read and using their memory to draw connections to past texts. He concludes with the example of the Oedipus complex, suggesting that these patterns have not just literary but also psychological implications.
* Examples: 
    - Faustian Bargaining with the devil. Mr. Lindner is sent to buy out the house that an African American family has just moved in to, and the African American family finds themselves in an awkward situation as they run out of money. Foster argues that Lindner is the devil, "[The family] can be rescued from the monetary crisis he has brought upon the family; all he has to do is admit that he’s not the equal of the white residents who don’t want him moving in, that his pride and self-respect, his identity, can be bought. If that’s not selling your soul, then what is it?""
    - Oedipal complex. Foster suggests that a "male subject [who is] hostile toward his father but much warmer and more loving toward, even dependent on, his mother" recalls the story of "a man who murders his father and marries his mother.", such that "your symbolic imagination will allow you to connect the earlier instance of this pattern with the real-life examples in front of you at the moment."
* Questions:
    - Does Chacko from _God of Small Things_ have an Oedipal complex? He is hostile to his father (forcing him to stop beating his wife), and grows to be quite close with Mammachi ("Men's needs"), and follows a tragic storyline, with his daughter dying.
    - In Phantom of the Opera, there are quite a few allusions to Faust. The chandelier falls during a performance of Faust, while the managers are bargaining with Erik, who is often compared to death or a devil in his appearance. Similarly, Christine disappears during a performance of Faust (because she was bargaining/arguing with Erik). But is this analysis correct? The book ends with lamenting how Erik could have been a better person had society treated him better, despite his hideous face. Are these allusions to Faust ironic?

# 1. Every Trip is a Quest (Except When It's Not)
* Thesis: A quest story usually involves a young protagonist going somewhere for some reason, facing trials on the way, and in the process, gains knowledge  or a deeper understanding about themselves. 
* Summary: Foster begins by describing a story which appears to be simply a teenager going to get bread, but then explains that it is structurally a quest. He then identifies the core aspects of a quest, points out that the real reason for the quest is self education, and analyzes this in the example of _The Crying of Lot 49_. 
* Examples: 
    - Kip, an underdog 16 year old, goes to run an errand for his mother, overcomes some challenges on the way there (a German Shepard), sees a girl he has a crush on with another boy he dislikes (for being rich and cool), and decides to join the army. The structure of this story follows a quest, "a knight (named Kip), a dangerous road (nasty German shepherds), a Holy Grail (one form of which is a loaf of Wonder Bread), at least one dragon (trust me, a ’68 ’Cuda could definitely breathe fire), one evil knight (Tony), one princess (who can either keep laughing or stop)."
* Questions:
    - I read quite a bit of fantasy, and this is definitely a trend. Even in middle-grade stories like Percy Jackson, it is clear that Percy is trying to figure out how he fits into this unfamiliar world. 
    - Can a quest occur without the protagonist actually travelling? For example, Shallan's story in _Way of Kings_ features Shallan, who needs to gain Jasnah's trust while avoiding assassins and distractions, a magical device which Shallan needs to obtain, an evil knight (Kabsal, though he presents himself as a likeable priest flirting with Shallan), and ends with Shallan learning more about herself and coming to terms with what she has done in her past at the end.

# 2. Nice to Eat with You: Acts of Communion
* Thesis: Eating is a shared experience, and thus establishes trust between two people or groups. In contrast, if it fails, that demonstrates a lack of trust for each other.
* Summary: Foster begins by claiming that all acts of eating are communion, which represent an act of peace or agreement. He then provides examples where eating is used in lieu of sex, to allow a bigot to realize the err of his ways after eating with someone, and then discusses how smoking is very similar, and perhaps even more intimate. Finally, he discusses the possibility of the eating being interrupted, describing a story where a mother is unable to bring her family together for dinner, symbolic of their overall tensions, or James Joyce using food to illustrate armies lined up against each other for the battlefield.
* Examples: 
    - Henry Fielding’s Tom Jones (1749) -- "Tom and his lady friend, Mrs. Waters, dine at an inn, chomping, gnawing, sucking on bones, licking fingers; a more leering, slurping, groaning, and, in short, sexual meal has never been consumed." Foster describes how eating is an act of communion, of trust and compassion, and how this can be used to symbolize sex.
   - Raymond Carver's "Cathedral" describes a bigoted man, "When the narrator watches the blind man eating—competent, busy, hungry, and, well, normal—he begins to gain a new respect for him. ... He discovers he has something in common with this stranger—eating as a fundamental element of life—that there is a bond between them.
   - This continuous when they smoke with the blind man afterward, which Foster describes as "I’m with you, I share this moment with you, I feel a bond of community with you."
   - Then, Foster discusses what happens when the meal is subverted, interrupted, or otherwise doesn't happen. A mother is unable to have a family dinner, until the family comes together after she dies, "at that point, of course, the body and blood they symbolically share are hers. Her life—and her death—become part of their common experience."
   - Similarly, he quotes James Joyce describing a table, "No writer ever took such care about food and drink, so marshaled his forces to create a military effect of armies drawn up as if for battle: ranks, files, “rival ends,” sentries, squads, sashes.".
* Questions
    - What about different types of meals? What if the King calls a feast? How are the implications of that different from a more intimate meal? What if the King is murdered at that feast? What about Arthur's feast of Pentecost, which is regularly interrupted by damsels in distress?
    - What about other, similar events? Watching TV together? One person making food for another? 

# 3. Nice to Eat You: Acts of Vampires
Thesis: Vampires in literature represent exploitation -- the denial of another's rights to sustain the vampire.
Summary: Foster begins with canonical examples of Vampires, like Dracula, and then moves on to talk more generally about ghosts, like in A Christmas Carol or Dr. Jekyll, and then the latest trend of sexualized vampires. in Twilight, for example. He argues that in all of this situations, the vampire or ghost is standing in for something, with the vampire usually consuming the life for or otherwise exploiting an innocent figure.
Examples:
    - The ghost of Hamlet's father is present to "point out something drastically wrong in Denmark’s royal household". The ghost represents something divine, sent to return the world to its natural order.

# 16. It's All About Sex
Thesis: Writers often use other objects to symbolize sex in situations where they either can't say it outright, or because it allows for a better more nuanced development of the idea.  
Summary: Foster begins by discussing Holy Grail stories symbolizing sex, the presents several examples in literature, using keys, bowls, or other toys, and concludes with an example involving masturbation and the Freudian Oedipal complex. 
Examples:
    - Holy Grail -- a young with a lance goes to find a chalice. "The knight becomes the emblem of pure, if untested, maleness in search of a chalice, the Holy Grail, which if you think about it is a symbol of female sexuality as understood once upon a time: the empty vessel, waiting to be filled."
    - A bowl in Ann Beattie's "Janus". The bowl, bought for her by her lover, which she beings to obsess over and identify with, not allowing her husband to use it, and ends with discovering her independence from being merely a sexual object. "it's about her identity as a woman, an individual, and a sexual being, rather than as an extension of a lover or a husband."
    - Rocking Horse -- "child desperately wants mother’s approval and love, child engages in highly secretive behavior involving frenetic, rhythmic activity that culminates in transporting loss of consciousness." -- Oedipal situation.

# Questions
1. Introduction: What does Foster mean by a “language of reading” (xxv)? What three items does Foster say separate the “professional reader” apart from the crowd, and why are these so important in interpreting literature? 
    a. Foster describes a "language of reading" as the "set of conventions and patterns, codes and rules, that we learn to employ in dealing with a piece of writing". For example, spring often evokes imagery of rebirth, new life, joyousness, happiness, etc. A professional reader is set apart by their use of memory, symbol, and pattern, which allow you to identify patterns and similarities that you have seen before, and figure out what various things symbolize, based on past experience. 
2. Chapter 1: You have read a lot of stories about quests. What does Foster say the quest story is really about? What is a quest story you have read and enjoyed (other than those he mentions)? 
    a. A quest story is really about self-knowledge, growing up and gaining maturity and experience. I'll go with American Gods by Neil Gaiman, where Shadow (an ex-convict) is released from prison, is confronted by a mentor Wednesday (Odin), who gives him a call to adventure. Shadow goes through several trials and tribulations facing the new "American Gods" despite not really understanding the world he's fallen into now that Wednesday has left, and ends Shadow hanging from the World Tree for 9 days like Odin did, with the goal of gaining the knowledge. This subverts to common idea of having a young teenage protagnist, and replacing it with Shadow, who is solid and isn't inexperienced, but Shadow, but pulls it off as Shadow is completely lost in this new world.
3. Chapter 2: What is Foster trying to say about communion here? 
    a. Communion is the great equalizer, which allows characters to empathize with each other. They recognize that they are both similar in that they have to eat, and it functions as an intimate momement to develop their relationship.
4. Chapter 4: What does Foster mean when he claims, “there’s no such thing as a wholly original work of literature” (24)? Do you agree or disagree with his statements here? Consider how chapters 5, 6, and 8 contribute to this point. 
    a. Foster is saying that all literature builds off of an interacts with previous literature, in a process known as intertextuality. All literature makes use of prevously established conventions and archetypes. I agree, it is often obvious how various stories interact with each other, and that authors are inspired by past stories. In Chapters 5-8, he discusses various sources of inspiration, Shakespeare, the Bible, Children's Stories, and Mythology.
5. Chapter 9: Explain how rain and snow are often paradoxical symbols (pages 71-73). 
6. Chapter 10: What point does Foster make about the purpose of supporting characters in a story? 
7. Chapter 12: What is Foster trying to say about the recognizing and defining symbols? Does he mean that there is no right and wrong answer as to what functions as a symbol and what it stands for? Explain. 
8. Chapter 14: In this chapter Foster asserts the importance of recognizing and understanding Christian imagery. Why does he believe that you need to “put aside your belief system, at least for the period during which you read” (126-127)? Do you agree? Explain. 
9. Chapters 19-20: In these chapters, Foster is trying to assert that the author makes deliberate choices about his or her setting, and readers should pay attention to these choices. What is a story that you have read where the geography or season greatly impacts the story? 
(Chapter 21: I don’t have a question for you here. Just keep in mind that the physical aspects of a character are also important and often symbolic.) 
10. Chapter 24: Cliff Fadiman said, “When you reread a classic you do not see more in the book than you did before; you see more in you than there was before.” How does this quote clarify or relate to Foster’s assertions in chapter 24? 
(Chapter 27: I have also assigned this chapter, but I don’t have questions for you on this one.)
