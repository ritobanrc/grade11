> You can brick up your heart as stout and tight and hard and cold and impregnable as you possibly can and down it comes in an instant, felled by a woman’s second glance, a child’s apple breath, the shatter of glass in the road, the words I have something to tell you, a cat with a broken spine dragging itself into the forest to die, the brush of your mother’s papery ancient hand in the thicket of your hair, the memory of your father’s voice early in the morning echoing from the kitchen where he is making pancakes for his children.


## Mimic



Each one visits a thousand flowers a day. They can dive at sixty miles an hour. They can fly backwards. They can fly more than five hundred miles without pausing to rest. But when they rest they come close to death: on frigid nights, or when they are starving, they retreat into torpor, their metabolic rate slowing to a fifteenth of their normal sleep rate, their hearts sludging nearly to a halt, barely beating, and if they are not soon warmed, if they do not soon find that which is sweet, their hearts grow cold, and they cease to be. Consider for a moment those hummingbirds who did not open their eyes again today, this very day, in the Americas: bearded helmet-crests and booted racket-tails, violet-tailed sylphs and violet-capped woodnymphs, crimson topazes and purple-crowned fairies, red-tailed comets and amethyst woodstars, rainbow-bearded thornbills and glittering-bellied emeralds, velvet-purple coronets and golden-bellied star-frontlets, fiery-tailed awlbills and Andean hillstars, spatuletails and pufflegs, each the most amazing thing you have never seen, each thunderous wild heart the size of an infant’s fingernail, each mad heart silent, a brilliant music stilled.

I thought it would be funny to overly dramatize and personify a server and a programmer.

Each one serves a thousand requests a day. They can handle a 100 requests a second. They can store gigabytes of data. They can stay online for decades without a single shutdown. But when there's a bug: a segmentation fault, or a buffer overflow, they crash, leading to angry calls made at 3 in the morning, cryptic error logs, and if the bug isn't fixed, if the memory leak isn't found, the programmer grows frustrated, and then angry. Consider for a moment, the programmers who awoke today to an angry text from their boss, here, in the Americas: bearded Linux-users and style Mac users, 60 year old veterans and new college graduates, open source contributors and Elon Musk employees, grizzly C++ programmers or budding python programmers, ethical hackers and penetration testers, system admins and network engineers, Go, Rust, C#, and Kotlin developers, each responsible for the most amazing thing you have ever seen, each server whirring along, hundreds of megawatts coursing through the wires, each one vigilant, a cacophony, a symphony, the internet.
