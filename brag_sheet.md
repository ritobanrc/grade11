## Questions

1. Majors I am considering: 
    - Computer Science/Engineering
    - Math
    - Physics
    - Chemistry
2. Desired Career:
    - Academia -- either teacher or researching in a field I am interested in
3. Is your academic record an accurate measure of your ability and potential? Explain.
    - Yes, I tend to get my work done, and am generally dedicated to doing well in my classes.
4. List 3 words that describe you and why.
    - Inquisitive. I always find new and interesting ideas on the forefront of computer science, a field I am interested in, and try to experiment with them myself.
    - Dilligent. Whether doing research in debate, or writing code, I try to be steady and meticulous, in order to not make mistakes. I do research before formulating opinions on issues, I do research before starting a new programming project, I do research before beginning my study of a Science Olympiad Event
    - Multidisciplinary. While I greatly enjoy computer science and programming, I'm also highly interested by the physical sciences, like chemistry. I also enjoy math, and participate in the AMC competitions. However, I'm not only a STEM Person. I understand the importance of the social sciences, and the impact they can have on peoples lives, so also participate in debate, to further educate myself on social issues, while also improving my public speaking ability to more effectively communicate my opinion on those issues. I also am a member of our school's YDSA chapter, because I understand the need for reform in our society, and think we all need to fight to improve our lives, moreso as climate change and global conflict become increasingly exigent threats.
5.  What Is your greatest strength and how have you used it?
6.  What is your one of your weaknesses? How have you overcome or compensated for this weakness?
8.  Whatâ€™s important to you? What are you passionate about? How have you pursued your interest in this area?
    a. I am greatly interested in computer science and engineering, and have pursued my interests in a numer of ways. I've taken courses on Coursera, I've done personal projects, I've done research myself, seeking out talks from conferences, and online tutorials for the subjects I am interested in.
    b. I'm also passionate about the issues affecting our society today. Not only have I joined debate, but I have actively educated myself based on the news, as well as looking back at history, both here in America, and in India, where my family is from. I have recently started reading some political theory as well.
7.  Do you have any leadership experience? This would include any club cabinet positions, sports team captain positions, summer job working with younger kids, or tutoring:
    - I have coached the middle school MATHCOUNTS for the past 1.5 years of my highschool career, which, at times, can be an extremely difficult challenge. Fifth graders are not easy to deal with.
    - Debate Leadership
    - STEMDev Vice President
    - YDSA President
9. Describe any special talents, hobbies, interests, travels that have influenced your growth and character.
    a. I'm going to specifically narrow down on talents and travels here, because I have discussed interests elsewhere. I do play piano, I find playing an instrument extremely enjoyable, something calming that I can dedicate myself to without stress. In middle school, I was a member of the school band, playing clarinet.  b. I also greatly enjoy my family's yearly-ish trips to India. It's very interesting seeing how American and Indian culture contrast, not to mention the amazing food, the rich history, and many of my other relatives. However, this past summer, my family decided to visit London and Paris instead. Visiting London had a profound impact on me, giving me context for what I am learning in AP Euro this year. I'm able to realize the opulence associated with the monarchies at the time. I was also able to compare and contrast British culture with American culture, which is particularly interesting, because India has quite a bit of British influence.
