# Part 7 Essay

Option 1: What are some of the film scores composed by John Williams? What makes his music so successful?


One of the most influential composers of the late 20th and early 21st century is John Williams. Nearly everyone has heard one of his instantly recognizable scores -- whether its the iconic Star Wars theme with its strong and bold perfect fifths, the ethereal and serene theme from Jurassic Park, or the majestic and whimsical voices of Hedwig's Theme from Harry Potter. Williams, who attended several extremely prestigious universities, including UCLA and Juilliard, got his first big movie opportunity with Jaws, and then composed for a series of blockbuster Hollywood films, including Indiana Jones and Superman. 


William's was particularly well known for his masterful use of the leitmotif. Leitmotifs, which were invented by Wagner for use in opera, are short musical phrases which represent a particular character, object, or idea in a drama that the composer can slowly develop and elaborate on over the course of the work. Star Wars features several of these leitmotifs, including the opening fanfare, the 'force' theme, Yoda's gentle melody, and Princess Leia's tune. Each of these is slowly developed over the course of the franchise, transformed to reflect the event being depicted. William's also develops several similar leitmotifs in the first Harry Potter film. For example, the mischief theme in the first movie first shows up when Harry speaks to the snake at the zoo, and again during their first flying class, and again when Fred and George show up at the Dursley's house in their flying care, and again in the third movie, where Harry received the Marauder's Map. The rest of the leitmotifs are similarly developed throughout the movies, showing up over and over again in different scenes and slowly building associations in the viewers mind. William's extensive use of leitmotifs makes his short but memorable melodies stay in the listener's head, so when we hear a phrase from one of his movies, we can instantly associate it with the ideas he's trying to convey.
