# Part 3 Essay
Option 3:
Describe the various components of opera, commenting on the function of each to the 
drama.

Opera is one of the most important musical innovations of the Baroque era, combining both acting and music to tell a story. In a sense, it can almost be seen as the precursor to modern theater, though with grander and more religious themes, and a significantly different style. Opera music roughly falls into two categories: recitative and aria. Recitative refers to a spoken-word style where the plot is advanced and the movement of the music reflects what is being said. In contrast to that, aria describes the more emotional style of opera music, in which time is briefly stopped to give a certain character the opportunity to release the emotional tension in a passionate piece of music. Generally, as the plot of the opera is advanced through recitative style, it makes up the bulk of the time, and is occasionally interrupted by aria to release the built up emotion. 

As an example of this, consider Henry Purcell's _Dido and Aeneas_, an opera based on the Roman poet Virgil's _Aeneid_. The opening of Act III is in recitative style, where the lyrics begin "Come away fellow sailors, come away," which advances the plot and is intended to explain to the audience what the context is -- clearly, it's not intended as a particularly emotional section. In contrast to that, Dido's lament, _When I am laid in earth_ is an Aria. Dido asks, "When I am laid in earth, may my wrongs create no trouble in thy breast". He repeats this several times, as though he's thinking about it and reassuring himself, and it's clear that this is an incredibly tense moment. 

As another famous example of an aria, consider Mozart's Queen of the Night Aria from The Magic Flute. Although Mozart is a classical composer, not a Baroque one, this is a very illustrative example. The soprano singer is clearly extremely emotional, saying "Death, despair, flame about me". In the mean time, all of the other characters are frozen, and only the Queen of the Night is moving. Once again, contrast between aria and recitative is clear, with arias serving as the emotional release for the characters, while recitative advances the plot.
