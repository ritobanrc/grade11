# Part 5 Essay

Option 3:
Describe Wagnerâ€™s innovations in opera and his desire to unite music and drama.

The Romantic Era in western music represented a reaction to the Enlightenment and classical ideas about form and structure. Romantic composers developed an extremely broad range of music ideas and style. One such Romantic was the German composer Richard Wagner. Wagner has been described as one of the most influential composers ever because of his development of the idea of musical theater. Where previous classical opera had a rigid structure involving arias and recitatives, Wagner developed the idea of "endless melody". The new idea of musical theater was seen as a "total artwork" which melded together "music, poetry, drama, and visual spectacle". 

One of Wagner's most influential contributions was the idea of a leitmotif, a short musical phrase that represents a specific idea or person that is reused and developed over the course of the work. For example, Act III Scene I of The Valkyrie features the introduction of leitmotif representing the Ride of the Valkyries. It enters being played by a brass instrument (possibly a French horn), and is then picked up by the trumpets and echoed throughout the piece. This motif is used numerous times throughout the play, slowly developed on, building up the musical picture of the Valkyries. Wagner's influence with the idea of the leitmotif really cannot be overstated. Nearly every musical and movie today features leitmotifs today. Famously, Howard Shore's beautiful award-winning score for the Lord of the Rings movies featured numerous leitmotifs, including the instantly-recognizable "One Ring" motif or the nostalgic "Shire" motif. Similar uses can be found in plays, ranging from Les Miserables' "One Day More" to Hamilton's "My Shot". Altogether, its no surprise that historians divide up the romantic period into before and after Wagner. Wagner's development of theater fuses together the worlds of music and acting into a truly magical experience.
