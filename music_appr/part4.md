# Part 4 Essay

Option 1:
What were some of the ways that Beethoven "shook up" the traditional strict formalities that composers prior to him observed religiously?


The 18th century in Europe saw a revival classical values and a new period of learning and political discourse. Among the cultural shifts taking place at this time was a significant change to music, with the creation of the modern conception of chamber music, symphonies, concertos, and sonatas, all with rigid rules and formalities. The famous composer Ludwig van Beethoven made significant strides and often flaunted some of these strict formalities. Indeed, Forney describes this tendency of Beethoven's as "strategic disruptions", which places him in a "transitional place" between convention and disruption, making Beethoven's work that much more powerful. 

Beethoven's Fifth Symphony provides a clear example of this. The first movement opens with the now instantly recognizable pattern of "short-short-short-long". Then, for nearly the entirety of the first movement, this motive is repeated, elaborated on and developed, first in pianissimo with violins and flutes, slowly growing until it concludes on the same motive at forte. Beethoven continues this, bringing in the French horn, introducing a second, more lyrical theme, and experimenting and developing the music while the initial rhythm of "short-short-short-long" underscores the entire piece. This "single-minded determination" was unique and already a significant departure from the existing symphony work. Although existing work featured this setup of exposition, development, and recapitulation, Beethoven took this exploration of the theme to a completely new level. 

Then, as is traditional, Beethoven continues with a slower and more flowing second movement. Nonetheless, even here, Beethoven pushes the bounds of what is possible, introducing a brass fanfare to contrast with the softer violins and woodwinds. In the third movement, Beethoven focusses on dramatic dynamic contrasts, further developing the rhythmic motive introduced in movement 1. This movement is also in C minor, where movement 1 was in C major, serving as contrast. Finally, in quite a new innovation, Beethoven moves on to movement four without pause. This returns to sonata-allegro form, with a fast tempo and more development of the same rhythmic motive. While in many ways, Beethoven's work here is a continuity from previous symphonies -- the influences are clear, and he respects many of the traditions developed so far -- Beethoven still uses his fifth symphony to explore new ideas, earning him the well-deserved moniker "Beethoven the hero".
