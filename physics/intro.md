* Classical Mechanics: Laws of Motion
* **Motion**: Change of orientation or position over time
    - **Trajectory**: The path which the object moves along
* Motion diagram: images equally spaced in time
    - Constant motion: images equally spaced in spaced as well, $\therefore$, constant speed 
    - Speeding up: increasing distance between objects
    - Slowing down: decreasing distance between objects
    - At rest: no movement
* Particle model:
    - Simplification where entire mass of object is placed at one point
* Position: defined by reference point (origin), distance, and direction
    - i.e. a coordinate system
* Displacement: change in position -- $\Delta x = x_f - x_i$
* Scalar: Single number with a unit, no direction
* Vector: Quantity with both a size and a direction
    - Size = Magnitude
    - Can be represented with an arrow
