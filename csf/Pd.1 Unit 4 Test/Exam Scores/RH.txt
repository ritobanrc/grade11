1)   1/5
The question asked you to write the expression as a product. Additionally, the algebra tiles should be layed out like this: 

+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
| x^2  | x^2  |x |x |x |x |x |
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x   |   x  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+

The x's should not be the same size as 1s, and should be below the x^2 (so the sides of the rectangle show the different factors).

2)   0/3
Should be only C.

3)   6/8
(d) should be 3p(5p - 1). Merely factoring out a 3 is not enough, you also need to factor out the p.

4)   5/5
In the future, make sure not to round intermediate steps. The answer should be 101.5, not 102.1.

5)   5/5
6)   3/3
7)   3/3
8)   3/3
9)   6/6
10)  6/6
