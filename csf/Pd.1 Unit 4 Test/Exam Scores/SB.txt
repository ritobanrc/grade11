1)   4/5
The question asked you to draw out the algebra tiles, not just the area model, so it should look like this: 

+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
| x^2  | x^2  |x |x |x |x |x |
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x   |   x  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+

2)   3/3

Well done!
