Should be cos(21) = 125/w, so w = 125/cos(21) = 133.9.

6)   1/3
Correct work, but arctan(27/38) = 35.4 degrees, not 86.

7)   0/3
Should use cos, not sin. arccos(13/20) = 49.5 degrees.

8)   1/3
Correct work, but arcsin(12/24) = 30 degrees, not 48.

9)   1/6
a is not area, (lowercase) a is the length of the side opposite angle A. 
Angle A = 31 degrees.
Angle B = 59 degrees.
a = sqrt(52) = 7.21.

10)   2/6
Angle B is correct, but a = 9.2, and c = 12.2. (lowercase) a refers to the side opposite angle A, and c refers to the side opposite angle C.

Bonus)   3/4
D is possible, (x - 1/2)(x + 1/2).

Total)   30/47
