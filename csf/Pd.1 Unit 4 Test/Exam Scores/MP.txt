When using algebra tiles, you only have tiles of size x^2, x, and 1. It should look like this:

+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
| x^2  | x^2  |x |x |x |x |x |
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x   |   x  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+

Bonus)   4/4
Well done! Though I'd advise against trying to type math in the future while working it out. As questions get more complicated, you become significantly more prone to errors than if you write it out by hand.
