1)   3/5
Whatever you drew, that's way too small for me to be able to see or read. It should look like this: 

+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
| x^2  | x^2  |x |x |x |x |x |
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x   |   x  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+

2)   3/3
3)   7/8
Make sure you completely simplify for (d); you can factor out a -1 from both, so they cancel. You should get 3p(5p - 1).

4)   5/5
Make sure you don't round intermediate steps. It should be 101.5.

5)   5/5
6)   3/3
7)   3/3
8)   3/3
9)   6/6
10)  6/6

Bonus)   3/4
Make sure you factor out -1 from both factors for c. It should be (4x + 1)^2.

Total)   47/47
