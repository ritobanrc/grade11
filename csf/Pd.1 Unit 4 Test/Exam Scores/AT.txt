The question asks you to write the quadratic as a product, and the algebra tiles should be layed out like this: 

The sides of your algebra tiles rectangle should correspond to the product, and the areas of each tile should correspond to the value being represented. This is what it should look like 
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
| x^2  | x^2  |x |x |x |x |x |
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x   |   x  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |
