1)   4/5
The area model should be arranged like this: 
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
| x^2  | x^2  |x |x |x |x |x |
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x   |   x  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+

2)   3/3
3)   7/8
You should factor (d) completely, it should be 3p(5p-1).

4)   3/5
Not sure what you did here, did you just round tan(44) to 1? Either way, it should be 101.5, not 98.

5)   3/5
Same issue here, seems like you rounded 0.93 to 0.9. The answer should be 133.9, not 138.9. 

6)   3/3
7)   3/3
8)   3/3
9)   6/6
10)  3/6
a should be 9.2, and c should be 12.2. This also seems to be because you rounded the intermediate results. Also, note that (lowercase) a means the side opposite angle A, and c means the side opposite angle C. 

Bonus)   0/4

Total)   38/47
