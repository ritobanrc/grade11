1)   3/5
The question asked you to draw out the algebra tiles, not just the area model, so it should look like this: 

+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
| x^2  | x^2  |x |x |x |x |x |
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x   |   x  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+

2)   0/3
The correct answer is C. 

3)   6/8
Make sure to completely simplify for both c and d. They should be
c. (m-2)(5m-4)  (you could factor out a -1 from both terms, and they'd cancel)
d. 3p(5p - 1)   (you can factor out a 3 from the second term)

4)   5/5
5)   5/5
6)   3/3
7)   3/3
8)   3/3
9)   6/6
10)  4/6
cos(49) = 8/c, not sin.

Bonus)   1/4
a. It's factorable (13x - 17)(13x + 17)
b. It should be (x+5)^2, not just (x+5). 
c. It should be (4x - 1)^2. You can't put the 2 to the left, that's not how exponent notation works. 

Total)   39/47
