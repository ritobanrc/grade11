1)   2/5
The question asked you to draw out the algebra tiles, not just the area model, so it should look like this: 

+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
| x^2  | x^2  |x |x |x |x |x |
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x   |   x  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+

Additionally, I don't see you writing it out as a product. You have each of the individual factors, but the question asks you to put them together. 

2)   3/3
3)   6/8
For (c), where is your answer?

4)   5/5
5)   5/5
6)   3/3
7)   3/3
8)   3/3
9)   6/6
10)  6/6

Bonus)   3/4
For (d), you can't just make the factor of 1/4 disappear, it's still a factor. So either, it should have been 1/4(2x + 1)(2x - 1), or (x - 1/2)(x + 1/2).

Total)   45/47
