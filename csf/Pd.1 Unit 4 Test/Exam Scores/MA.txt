1)   4/5
The question asked you to draw out the algebra tiles, not just the area model, so it should look like this: 

+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
| x^2  | x^2  |x |x |x |x |x |
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x   |   x  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+


2)   3/3
3)   8/8
4)   5/5
5)   5/5
6)   3/3
7)   3/3
8)   0/3
You shouldn't be using tan here at all. You have the opposite (12) and the hypotenuse (24), so you should be using sin. sin(x) = 12/24, x = 30 degrees.

9)   6/6
10)  6/6

Bonus)   4/4
While your solution for d is correct, a simpler solution would be (x + 1/2)(x - 1/2).

Well done!
