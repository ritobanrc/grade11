1)   3/5
The sides of your algebra tiles rectangle should correspond to the product, and the areas of each tile should correspond to the value being represented. This is what it should look like 
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
| x^2  | x^2  |x |x |x |x |x |
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x   |   x  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+

2)   3/3
3)   8/8
Your explanation for part B should be something like "there aren't any pairs of numbers that add to 7 and also multiply to 7".

4)   5/5
When the question asks you to round to the nearest tenth, you should make sure to do that.

5)   5/5
Same as 4

6)   3/3
7)   3/3
8)   3/3
9)   6/6
The question asked you to find a, but you wrote b = 7.21. Make sure you use the letters the question gives you.

10)   5/6
You have a and c backwards. (lowercase) a refers to the side opposite angle A, and (loewrcase) c refers to the side opposite angle C.

Bonus)   0/4

Total)   45/47
