1)   4/5
The question asked you to draw out the algebra tiles, not just the area model, so it should look like this: 

+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
| x^2  | x^2  |x |x |x |x |x |
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x   |   x  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+

2)   3/3
3)   6/8
a. 2 pts -- though you should usually write the x first, so it should ideally be be (2x - 3)(x - 4), not (-3 + 2x)(1x -4).
b. 2 pts
c. 1 pt -- the second factor should be (m - 2), not (-m - 2).
d. 1 pt -- make sure to factor completely, you could still take a 3 out, so it should have been 3p(5p - 1).
