1)   3/5
Factored corretly, but the area model should look like this: 

+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
| x^2  | x^2  |x |x |x |x |x |
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x   |   x  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+

x's should be long and thin, and should be lined up with the x^2s. 


2)   3/3
3)   8/8
For (d), make sure you use the variable given in the problem. If the problem says p, don't use x in your answer. 

4)   4/5
Your work isn't quite right, it should be tan(44) = 98/x, not x/98.

5)   4/5
Your work isn't quite right, it should be cos(21) = 125/w. tan(21) does not equal 125/w. Again, make sure to use the variable given in the problem, w, not x. 

6)   3/3
7)   3/3
8)   3/3
9)   6/6
10)  6/6

Bonus)   4/4
Well done!

Total)   47/47
