1)   3/5
The question asked you to draw out the algebra tiles, not just the area model, so it should look like this. Also, in the future, please don't try to cram a diagram into 1 line of a page -- I can't tell what you've written inside the boxes, I can't see if there is an x next to the 5, so I can't give you partial credit even for having a correct area model.

3)   6/8
a. 2 pts
b. 2 pts
c. 1 pt. Should be (5m - 4)(m - 2), not (5m - 4)(m - 2m)
d. 1 pt. Make sure to factor completely, you can still take out a -1 from both factors, making it 3p(5p - 1).

You have a and c backwards. Remember the a refers to the side opposite angle A, and c refers to the side opposite angle C.

Bonus)   2/4
a. 1 pt
b. 1 pt
c. Make sure to factor completely, you can still take a -1 out of both factors, so it should be (4x - 1)^2.
d. It is possible to factor, (x - 1/2)(x + 1/2).

Total)   44/47
