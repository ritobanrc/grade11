1)   5/5
2)   3/3
3)   7/8
You have (2x + 3)(x+4), but the second factor should be (x-4), since question has -11x.

4)   5/5
5)   5/5
6)   3/3
7)   3/3
8)   3/3
9)   5/6
You have angle A and angle B mixed up -- A should be 31, B should be 59.

10)   5/6
Angle B should be 41, not 51. 90 - 49 = 41, not 51.

Bonus)   3/4
(d) can be factored as (x + 1/2)(x - 1/2).

Total)   47/47
