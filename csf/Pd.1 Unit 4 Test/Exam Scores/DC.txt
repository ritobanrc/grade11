1)   4/5
The question asked you to draw out the algebra tiles, not just the area model, so it should look like this: 

+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
| x^2  | x^2  |x |x |x |x |x |
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x   |   x  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+

2)   3/3
3)   8/8
4)   5/5
5)   5/5
6)   3/3
You don't need that many significant digits LMAO. Usually 3 is enough.

7)   3/3
8)   3/3
Make sure to include the degrees symbol when writing degrees.

9)   6/6
Same as #8.

10)  6/6
Same as #8, and you have a and c backwards. Remember that a means the side opposite angle A, and c means the side opposite angle C. I didn't mark you off for this, since you labelled the diagram correctly, but you should try to follow conventions wherever possible.

Bonus)   4/4
Well done!

Total)   50/47
