1)   4/5
The question asked you to draw out the algebra tiles, not just the area model, so it should look like this: 

+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
| x^2  | x^2  |x |x |x |x |x |
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x   |   x  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+

2)   0/3
The correct answer is C

3)   7/8
(c) should be (5m - 4)(m - 2), not (5m + 4)(m + 2).

4)   2/5
You had tan(44) = 98/x, which is correct, but then, you rearranged it incorrectly to x = 98tan(44). What you should have had is x = 98/tan(44) = 101.5.

5)   2/5
Same as #4. cos(21) = 125/w is correct, but that should rearrange to w = 125/cos(21) = 133.9.

6)   3/3
7)   3/3
8)   3/3
9)   6/6
10)  5/6
You have a and c backwards. Remember the a refers to the side opposite angle A, and c refers to the side opposite angle C.

Bonus)   0/4

Total)   35/47
