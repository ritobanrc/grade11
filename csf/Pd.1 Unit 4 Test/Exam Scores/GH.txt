1)   3/5
The question asked you to draw out the algebra tiles, not just the area model, so it should look like this: 

+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
| x^2  | x^2  |x |x |x |x |x |
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x   |   x  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+

2)   0/3
It should be C.

3)   2/8
Factoring means writing out the equation as a product, merely filling out the area model is not enough.

a. (2x - 3)(x - 4) -- you get 1 pt
b. Not factorable
c. (m - 2)(5m - 4) -- you get 1 pt
d. 3p(5p - 1)

4)   1/5
It should be tan(44) = 98/x, x = 101.5, not 94.6.

5)   2/5
Correct setup here, but when rearranging, you should get w = 125/cos(21) = 133.9, not w=125 * cos(21).

6)   3/3
7)   3/3
8)   3/3
9)   6/6
10)  5/6
You have a and c backwards. (lowercase) a means the side opposite angle A, and c means the side opposite angle C.
