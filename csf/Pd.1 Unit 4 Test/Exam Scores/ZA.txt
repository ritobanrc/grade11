1)   3/5
The algebra tiles should look like this:

+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
| x^2  | x^2  |x |x |x |x |x |
|      |      |  |  |  |  |  |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+
|  x   |   x  |1 |1 |1 |1 |1 |
+------+------+--+--+--+--+--+

The xs should be long and skinny, not the same size as the 1s, and they should be organized so each side of the rectangle shows the product. 


2)   3/3
3)   7/8
d should be 3p(5p - 1). There should be a p^2 inside any of the factors.

4)   5/5
5)   5/5
6)   3/3
7)   3/3
8)   3/3
9)   6/6
10)  4/6
a = 9.2, not 7.

Bonus)   3/4
D is possible, (x - 1/2)(x + 1/2).

Total)   45/47
