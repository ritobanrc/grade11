 * Nearly everyone lost at least 1 point on question 1, either because they interpreted algebra tiles to mean area model (took off 1 point here), or they didn't understand how they should the algebra tiles should be arranged (also took off 1 point, if the dimensions were right), or they completely didn't understand algebra tiles, like the tiles were the wrong shape (so I took off 2 points).
    - I included a little ASCII art of the solution, no idea if it's going to look ok on Google Classroom, but if it doesn't, they can just copy-paste it into notepad or smth.

* For 3, the most common mistake was people getting the signs wrong, or not completely factoring (I took 1 point off for both). I might have been a bit too harsh on some of the "completely factoring", I took off 1 point when they could have factored out a -1 from both factors. Additionally, a bunch of people wrote you can't factor (d) because "you can't factor 0", or something like that.
* Most people were fine with 4-8, and mistakes were usually algebra (like rearranging tan(44) = 98/x to x = 98tan(44) instead of x = 98/tan(44)).
* A lot of people had a and c backwards on 10 -- didn't realize that a = side opposite angle A and c = side opposite angle C.
* Quite a few people thought you couldn't factor d on the bonus (since it's a "rational number" or smth), and some people factored it as 1/4(2x - 1)(2x + 1) (I accepted this as a valid answer, since it's the same).
