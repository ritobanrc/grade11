# Introduction: How'd he do That?

## Overall Argument

Actually, neither of these is the case; rather, the professor, as the slightly **more experienced reader**, has acquired over the years the use of a certain **“language of reading,”** something to which the students are only beginning to be introduced. What I’m talking about is a grammar of literature, a **set of conventions and patterns, codes and rules, that we learn to employ in dealing with a piece of writing.**

**Stories and novels have a very large set of conventions**: types of characters, plot rhythms, chapter structures, point-of-view limitations. Poems have a great many of their own, involving form, structure, rhythm, rhyme. Plays, too. And then there are conventions that cross genre lines. Spring is largely universal. So is snow. So is darkness. And sleep. When spring is mentioned in a story, a poem, or a play, a veritable constellation of associations rises in our imaginative sky: youth, promise, new life, young lambs, children skipping . . . on and on. And if we associate even further, that constellation may lead us to more abstract concepts such as rebirth, fertility, renewal.

**Memory. Symbol. Pattern.** These are the three items that, more than any other, separate the professorial reader from the rest of the crowd. ... Everything is a symbol of something, it seems, until proven otherwise. We ask, Is this a metaphor? Is that an analogy? What does the thing over there signify? 


## Examples
**Bargains with the devil** go back a long way in Western culture. In all the versions of the **Faust legend**, which is the dominant form of this type of story, the **hero is offered something he desperately wants**—power or knowledge or a fastball that will beat the Yankees—**and all he has to give up is his soul.** 

Let’s say that a **male subject** you are studying exhibits behavior and makes statements that show him to be **hostile toward his father but much warmer and more loving toward, even dependent on, his mother**.  ... Your memory may dredge up something from experience, not your clinical work but a play you read long ago in your youth about a **man who murders his father and marries his mother.** Even though the current examples have nothing to do with drama, your symbolic imagination will allow you to connect the earlier instance of this pattern with the real-life examples in front of you at the moment. And your talent for nifty naming will come up with something to call this pattern: the **Oedipal complex.**


# 1. Every Trip is a Quest (Except When It's Not)
We know, however, that their quest is educational. They don’t know enough about the only subject that really matters: themselves. **The real reason for a quest is always self-knowledge. That’s why questers are so often young, inexperienced, immature, sheltered.**

## Examples
That’s a list I can live with: a knight (named Kip), a dangerous road (nasty German shepherds), a Holy Grail (one form of which is a loaf of Wonder Bread), at least one dragon (trust me, a ’68 ’Cuda could definitely breathe fire), one evil knight (Tony), one princess (who can either keep laughing or stop).


# 2. Nice to Eat with You: Acts of Communion
**whenever people eat or drink together, it’s communion**

Here’s the thing to remember about communions of all kinds: in the real world, breaking bread together is an **act of sharing and peace**, since if you’re breaking bread you’re not breaking heads. 

So too in literature. And in literature, there is another reason: **writing a meal scene is so difficult, and so inherently uninteresting, that there really needs to be some compelling reason to include one in the story. And that reason has to do with how characters are getting along. Or not getting along.** Come on, food is food. 

## Examples
Henry Fielding’s Tom Jones (1749), which, as one of my students once remarked, “sure doesn’t look like church.” Specifically, Tom and his lady friend, Mrs. Waters, dine at an inn, chomping, gnawing, sucking on bones, licking fingers; a more leering, slurping, groaning, and, in short, sexual meal has never been consumed. 


 Or in Carver’s story, cube steak. **When the narrator watches the blind man eating—competent, busy, hungry, and, well, normal—he begins to gain a new respect for him.** The three of them, husband, wife, and visitor, ravenously consume the cube steak, potatoes, and vegetables, and in the course of that experience our narrator finds his antipathy toward the blind man beginning to break down. **He discovers he has something in common with this stranger—eating as a fundamental element of life—that there is a bond between them.**


Smoking weed --
On the other hand, here is **a substance they take into their bodies in a shared, almost ritualistic experience.** Once again, the act says, **“I’m with you, I share this moment with you, I feel a bond of community with you.” It may be a moment of even greater trust.** In any case, the alcohol at supper and the marijuana after combine to relax the narrator so he can receive the full force of his insight, so he can share in the drawing of a cathedral (which, incidentally, is a place of communion).

Subverting it indicates conflict:


Or consider Anne Tyler’s Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant (1982). The mother tries and tries to have a family dinner, and every time she fails. Someone can’t make it, someone gets called away, some minor disaster befalls the table. Not until her death can her children assemble around a table at the restaurant and achieve dinner; at that point, of course, the body and blood they symbolically share are hers. Her life—and her death—become part of their common experience.

No writer ever took such care about food and drink, so marshaled his forces to create a military effect of armies drawn up as if for battle: ranks, files, “rival ends,” sentries, squads, sashes. Such a paragraph would not be created without having some purpose, some ulterior motive. 


# 3. Nice to Eat You: Acts of Vampires

Evil has had to do with sex since the serpent seduced Eve. What was the upshot there? Body shame and unwholesome lust, seduction, temptation, danger, among other ills.

selfishness, exploitation, a refusal to respect the autonomy of other people

The essentials of the vampire story, as we discussed earlier: **an older figure representing corrupt, outworn values; a young, preferably virginal female; a stripping away of her youth, energy, virtue; a continuance of the life force of the old male; the death or destruction of the young woman**.

That’s what this figure really comes down to, whether in Elizabethan, Victorian, or more modern incarnations: **exploitation** in its many forms. Using other people to get what we want. **Denying someone else’s right to live in the face of our overwhelming demands. Placing our desires, particularly our uglier ones, above the needs of another. **

## Examples
Think of the **ghost of Hamlet’s** father when he takes to appearing on the castle ramparts at midnight. He’s not there simply to haunt his son; he’s there to **point out something drastically wrong in Denmark’s royal household**

**Marley’s ghost** in A Christmas Carol (1843), who is really a walking, clanking, moaning **lesson in ethics for Scrooge.**

The hideous Edward **Hyde exists to demonstrate to readers that even a respectable man has a dark side**; like many Victorians, Robert Louis Stevenson believed in the **dual nature of humans**, and in more than one work he finds ways of showing that duality quite literally. In The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886) he has Dr. J. drink a potion and become his evil half,


Meyer’s great innovation is to center the stories on a nonvampire teenage girl and young (these things are relative, I guess) **vampire who loves her but must fight his bloodlust**. Much has been made of the element of the bloodsucking (and therefore sexual) restraint of the novels, notable in a genre where traditionally the main figures have had no self-control at all. What turned out to be unrestrained was the reading appetite of teenagers; Meyer was the top-selling American author in 2008 and 2009. Critics generally cringed, but, clearly, adolescents don’t read book reviews.
