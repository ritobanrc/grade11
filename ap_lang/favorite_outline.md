Knife of Dreams, Book 11 of the Wheel of Time

* Premise

> The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.


* Character Arcs
    - Mat's arc from an incorrigible teenager to leader, hero
    - Perrin's arc from a careful and unsure blacksmith, to being thrust into a position of power, conflicted about how his past life as a blacksmith contrasts with his new life as a leader.
    - Egwene's arc from the innkeepers daughter to perhaps the most important political figure in the land

Quote: 

From Gathering Storm

> He regarded the world beneath him. The clouds above had finally broken, if only just above him. The gloom dispersed, allowing him to see the sun hanging just above.
> Rand looked up at it. Then he smiled. Finally, he let out a deep-throated laugh, true and pure.
> It had been far too long. 


Context -- Rand, the Dragon Reborn, who has been hearing a past incarnation of himself in his head, and growing increasingly paranoid about his ability to fulfill his role in the Last Battle, increasingly distrustful of everyone else, and increasingly emotionless and stolid, after threatening to murder his own father, travels to Dragonmount, the mountain created by the death of his previous incarnation. Rand climbs to the top of the mountain, trying to understand his purpose, and he descends with the understanding that we continue to live to love, and to have another chance as the wheel turns.


He regarded the world beneath him. -- both literal (Rand is literally on the higest mountain in their world), but also references Rand's nihilistic discussion earlier, and foreshadows some events later. Rand has the power to end the world, end the wheel of time, to end suffering


The clouds above had finally broken, if only just above him. -- the clouds
