## What Is Imperialism?
According to Vladimir Lenin, imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism. Essentially, imperialism is the set of policies and practices that the United States and other developed capitalist powers engaged in to obtain raw materials from poorer less developed countries, taking advantage of them and their more vulnerable populations in the process. 

As the United States economy grew, it's people developed labor unions and (some) employment protections, started expecting higher wages, US business began to look abroad. The growing concentration of capital, with the monopolization and horizontal integration of Carnegie and Rockefeller made it possible for them to engage in such policies.
