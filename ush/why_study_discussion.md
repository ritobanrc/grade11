## Discussion Questions

1. What does the author mean when he says that history shows us our limits? Explain using his words and examples.  
    - He says that history is humbling. When we learn history, we realize that our past involves embarrassment and failure. Even our brightest scientists like Newton experience failures of judgement, and were confident about it. Therefore, the author suggests that we should be similarly skeptical about our own current knowledge and doubt the assumptions we make, and by studying history and becoming familiar with our past failings, we can become more acquainted with how to recognize them in ourselves.

2. Explain what the author means when he says "progress is fragile and reversible."
    - The author means that it is always possible for society to fall backwards into bigotry and hatred. He demonstrates this using the example of the Weimar Republic, and says that learning history teaches us this with other examples as well.

3. When the author says that history reminds of the power of chance, what does he mean?
    - He means that history keeps us aware of the "butterfly effect" -- the idea that a butterfly flapping its wings in the Amazon could indirectly lead to a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. He says that studying history reminds us of situations where minor decisions and randomness had huge impacts, like the American Revolution or Nazi Germany.

4. Explain what the author is referring to when he says "march towards the promised land." Why do you think Americans believe that history is "a march towards the promised land?"
    - The "march towards the promised land" is the idea that there is some utopia that will naturally come about simply because of the way that our systems have been built. This world view comes about from the idea of "American superiority" that we have been told since elementary school. 

5. The author seems to believe that we can learn from our mistakes. Do you think history can teach us lessons? Why or why not?
    - History certainly can teach us lessons. Its the fundamental underpinning of sociology, without which we can't really make sociological predictions.
