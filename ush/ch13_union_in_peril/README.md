## Fruits of Manifest Destiny
* See Chapter 12

## A Dose of Arsenic
* Mexico is larger than the Louisiana Purchase 
* Question of whether slavery should expand to new territories proves fatal
* Emerson compares purchasing Mexico to "swallowing arsenic"

### The Wilmot Proviso
* **Wilmot Proviso**
    - Previously, slavery issues settled by Missouri Compromise/state legislatures
    - _David Wilmot_ (Rep, Pennsylvania) proposes that all new territories from Mexico should be free
    - Votes completely break from party lines

### The Free Soil Appeal
* **Northern Incentive for Abolition**
    - Congress lacks authority to abolish slavery in a state, but can ban slavery in a territory
    - Northerners dislike Southern influence in government
* **Desire to Expand**
    - Many northerners want to move to new western territories
    - Exacerbated by Panic of 1837, ensuing depression
    - Labor movement supports expansionism
* **The Free Soil Platform**
    - Oppose expansion of slavery, _because_ it would block off northern migration to the West
    - Free Soil platform blocks slavery, but _also_ calls for government homesteads
    - Wilmot focusses on preventing whites from competing with black labor
* **Southern opposition to Free Soil Movements**
    - See Mexican territories as their "right", affront to Southern way of Life
    - Also risks of soil exhaustion necessitate that slavery expand

### Crisis and Compromise

    - Charists in Britain demand democratic reforms
    - France overthrows the monarchy (again, and Napoleon III comes to power afterwards)
    - Hungarians declare independence
    - Italian and German nationalists demand unification
    - Most of these eventually crushed
* **Compromise of 1850**
    - California seeks to join the Union as a free state
    - Henry Clay's solution:
        * California enters as a free state

    - President _Zachary Taylor_: Southerner, but supports unity above everything else, insists that congress admit California, accuses Southerners of holding California Hostage 
    - Taylor dies, _Millard Fillmore_ comes to power, supports Compromise of 1850, and it passes

### The Fugitive Slave Issue
* **Effects of the Fugitive Slave Act**
    - Creates a commission to determine fate of fugitive slaves w/o trial
    - Prohibits local authorities from interfering, requires individual citizens to assist
    - 157 Slaves returned to South
* **Reaction to the Law**
    - Lets Slave Catchers enter California, other free states
    - Emerson, other transcendentalists speak out against it -- overrides individual freedom
    - Abolitionists violently resist
        * Some rescued from Jails

## Conclusion
One of the most interesting events that led to the Civil War was the case of Dred Scott v. Sandford. In this case, a slave Dred Scott, was taken into the Wisconsin territory by his master, and then returned to the slave state of Missouri. Dred Scott sued, first in state court, then in federal court, arguing that since he had been taken into a free state, he had been freed. However, when the case arrived at SCOTUS, instead of merely ruling on the case at hand, Justice Robert Taney ruled that (a) African Americans were not citizens protected by the US constitution, (b) that Congress doesn't have the authority to rule about slaves under the property clause, and (c) substantive due process must be respected -- the federal government cannot free the slaves without going through due process first. I think this ruling reveals several interesting things about the judicial philosophy used to approach it. As Justice Curtis's dissent points out, 5/13 states at the time of ratification allowed African Americans to vote, so (a) is just factually untrue. This reveals the underlying assumption with originalist interpretations of the Constitution, that past society was inherently more regressive, and that it can be used to enforce regressive and reactionary policies. Interestingly, Justice Scalia compares the decision in Roe v. Wade to the Dred Scott decision, suggesting that their use of substantive due process is similar. I find it particularly interesting that the due process aspect is the part that Scalia chooses to focus on, instead of recognizing that one ruling expands the freedom of people, while the other vastly restricts it.
