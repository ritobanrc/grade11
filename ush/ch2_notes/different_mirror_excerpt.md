## 3-2-1 Analysis

### 3 things learned
* The English treatment of Indians in America was foreshadowed by and heavily inspired from the English conquest of Ireland. Queen Elizabeth I believed that Ireland posed political threat to England, being Catholic and possibly allying with France or Spain, and encouraged its colonization. And much like the Indians, the Irish were viewed as less than the English, "lack[ing] 'knowledge of God or good manners.'", did not own property, did not "improve their lands" or "live together in setled [sic] Villages or Townes", "'naturally' given to 'idleness'". Altogether, this stereotyping created created a distinct class divide between the English and the Irish, and went on to be codified into law. The Irish were forbidden from "wear[ing] English apparel", "purchase land, bare office, be chosen of any jury, or admitted witness", or intermarry with the English. The English sought to impose their colonization with violence, to "teach duty and obedience", burning villages, murdering families, and prominently displaying the heads of those they killed. These tendencies, as they applied to the Irish, can almost be thought of as a practice round for the English, as it heavily influence what happened to the Indians. Many of the early colonizers had also participated in the invasion of Ireland, including "Sir Humphrey Gilbert, Lord De La Warr, Sir Francis Drake, and Sir Walter Raleigh", and the two ideas, colonization of the New World and colonization of Ireland can often be seen discussed in tandem in correspondences of people at the time. Right from the beginning, the English started to draw comparisons between the Irish and the Indians, comparing deerskin robes to Irish mantels, their fighting styles, where the forests of New England were "like the bogs to the wild Irish", 

* Many people, including Thomas Jefferson, believed that the settlers and Indians could be friends and cooperate. However, in practice, they meant that the Indians would give up their way of life and adopt the European lifestyle.

* Indians were often, often literally with the devil, so the concept of Puritanism became defined by excluding the Indians.

### 2 connections
* Shakespeare's play _The Tempest_   
* Right from the beginning, the Europeans viewed themselves as holy and superior. 

### 1 critique
* Takaki does a particularly good job walking a fine line between actually portraying the horror of what was done to the Indians, while also avoiding accidentally falling into the "noble savage" stereotype.
