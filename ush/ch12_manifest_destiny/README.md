### Election of 1844
- Conflict within Democratic party
    * Northerners want _Martin Van Buren_ (oppose annexing Texas, since it's a slave state)
    * Southerners want _John C. Calhoun_ (proslavery, proannexation)
    * Eventually decide on James K. Polk -- expansionist, annex Texas, reoccupy Oregon, acquite California
- _Henry Clay_ is Whig nominee, wavers on Texas annexation
    * NY abolitionists vote third-party, "Liberty Party"
- James K. Polk runs on claiming Texas, Oregon, Maine -- and wins
    - Opponent, Henry Clay opposes annexation → Some whigs switch to Liberty Party
- Expansionism → conflict

### Annexing Texas and dividing Oregon

    - _Zachary Taylor_ push Mexicans south of Rio Grande, wins at Buena Vista
    - _Winfield Scott_ invades central Mexico, takes Vera Cruz and Mexico City

        * Passes in House, defeated in Senate
    - **Prelude to Civil War**: Tensions increasing, slave v. free power

### James K. Polk War Message
* **Lincoln's Response**:
    - Lincoln first tries to determine who controls the territory, and whether the Texans in the area actually recognize and pay taxes to the US govt. He then asks about their reaction to the invasion was, implying that they did not appreciate it, suggesting that they fled as the US military approached. Finally, he asks about Polk and his secretary of war's individual culpability in the actions, asking about what exactly they ordered. 
    - The implied message is that Polk was wrong to invade Mexico, that he doesn't have a duty to protect these people who aren't even American citizens.

* **Gadsen Purchase**: Mexico sells southern parts of New Mexico and Arizona, Pierce wants to build a railroad there

### Expansion After the Civil War

## Conclusion
One of the most interesting events that led to the Civil War was the case of Dred Scott v. Sandford. In this case, a slave Dred Scott, was taken into the Wisconsin territory by his master, and then returned to the slave state of Missouri. Dred Scott sued, first in state court, then in federal court, arguing that since he had been taken into a free state, he had been freed. However, when the case arrived at SCOTUS, instead of merely ruling on the case at hand, Justice Robert Taney ruled that (a) African Americans were not citizens protected by the US constitution, (b) that Congress doesn't have the authority to rule about slaves under the property clause, and (c) substantive due process must be respected -- the federal government cannot free the slaves without going through due process first. I think this ruling reveals several interesting things about the judicial philosophy used to approach it. As Justice Curtis's dissent points out, 5/13 states at the time of ratification allowed African Americans to vote, so (a) is just factually untrue. This reveals the underlying assumption with originalist interpretations of the Constitution, that past society was inherently more regressive, and that it can be used to enforce regressive and reactionary policies. Interesting, Justice Scalia compares the decision in Roe v. Wade to the Dred Scott decision, suggesting that their use of substantive due process is similar. I find it particularly interesting that the due process aspect is the part that Scalia chooses to focus on, instead of recognizing that one ruling expands the freedom of people, while the other vastly restricts it.

### Reflection: Indigenous People's History -- From Sea to Shining Sea
1. In a few sentences, describe a similarity or difference in the experiences of Indigenous peoples from modern day Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and California prior to the colonization by the United States.
    - The Indigenous people throughout California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas all faced varying degrees of invasion and oppression by the Spanish. In California, Father Junipero Serra built the now-famous Mission San Diego and the El Camino Real, both crucial parts of the overall mission system. In these missions, Indigenous people were often kidnapped by soldiers and forced into hard labor, under the premise of being converted to Catholicism. In the Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah areas, the Spanish invaded in 1598, they destroyed most of the towns, referred to as Pueblos, and enslaved most of the Pueblo Indians, forcing them to provide soldiers for the Spanish military to attack other Indigenous peoples.
2. In a few sentences, describe how the U.S. colonization of Northern Mexico began and the impact it had on Indigenous peoples of the broad, Northern Mexico region.
    - The US colonization of Northern Mexico began under Jefferson's Administration, sending the army lieutenant Zebulon Pike to take a small force to reconnoiter the area. But instead, Pike "accidentally" built a fort, was detained by Spanish authorities, and then wrote a book recounting the lucrative fur and silver trade. Soon after, US settlers began using Mexico's land grant system to groups of over 2000 families, and Indigenous people who interfered with their passage and encroachment onto their lands were 2000 families, and Indigenous people who interfered with their passage and encroachment onto their lands were attacked.
3. In a few sentences, describe how this reading either enhances or changes our understanding of Manifest Destiny.
    - One important aspect of Manifest Destiny that this chapter reveals is the implicit assumption that Manifest Destiny could only apply to white, Anglo-American settlers. We often don't realize that it would have been entirely possible to admit Native American tribes into the Union, but as this chapter points out, states were only admitted once the number of white settlers outnumbered the number of Indigenous people. Even among anti-war writers at the time, like Thoreau and Lowell, there was an implicit assumption that white people and Indigenous people could not mix, that it would be impossible to have a country where both white people and Indigenous people would live harmoniously together. Even Thoreau's objection to the Mexican-American war was not on grounds of protecting the Native Americans, but because of objections over how his tax money was used. I think that's particularly interesting, because this idea that was for so long assumed to be impossible is in many ways exactly the challenge we face today.
