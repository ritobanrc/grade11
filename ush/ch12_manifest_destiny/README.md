He then asks about their reaction to the invasion was, implying that they did not appreciate it, suggesting that they fled as the US military approached. Finally, he asks about Polk and his secretary of war's individual culpability in the actions, asking about what exactly they ordered.

### Reflection: Indigenous People's History -- From Sea to Shining Sea
1. In a few sentences, describe a similarity or difference in the experiences of Indigenous peoples from modern day Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and California prior to the colonization by the United States.
    - The Indigenous people throughout California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas all faced varying degrees of invasion and oppression by the Spanish. In California, Father Junipero Serra built the now-famous Mission San Diego and the El Camino Real, both crucial parts of the overall mission system. In these missions, Indigenous people were often kidnapped by soldiers and forced into hard labor, under the premise of being converted to Catholicism. In the Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah areas, the Spanish invaded in 1598, they destroyed most of the towns, referred to as Pueblos, and enslaved most of the Pueblo Indians, forcing them to provide soldiers for the Spanish military to attack other Indigenous peoples.
2. In a few sentences, describe how the U.S. colonization of Northern Mexico began and the impact it had on Indigenous peoples of the broad, Northern Mexico region.
    - The US colonization of Northern Mexico began under Jefferson's Administration, sending the army lieutenant Zebulon Pike to take a small force to reconnoiter the area. But instead, Pike "accidentally" built a fort, was detained by Spanish authorities, and then wrote a book recounting the lucrative fur and silver trade. Soon after, US settlers began using Mexico's land grant system to groups of over 2000 families, and Indigenous people who interfered with their passage and encroachment onto their lands were 2000 families, and Indigenous people who interfered with their passage and encroachment onto their lands were attacked.
3. In a few sentences, describe how this reading either enhances or changes our understanding of Manifest Destiny.
    - One important aspect of Manifest Destiny that this chapter reveals is the implicit assumption that Manifest Destiny could only apply to white, Anglo-American settlers. We often don't realize that it would have been entirely possible to admit Native American tribes into the Union, but as this chapter points out, states were only admitted once the number of white settlers outnumbered the number of Indigenous people. Even among anti-war writers at the time, like Thoreau and Lowell, there was an implicit assumption that white people and Indigenous people could not mix, that it would be impossible to have a country where both white people and Indigenous people would live harmoniously together. Even Thoreau's objection to the Mexican-American war was not on grounds of protecting the Native Americans, but because of objections over how his tax money was used. I think that's particularly interesting, because this idea that was for so long assumed to be impossible is in many ways exactly the challenge we face today.
