# Interpretation: Causes of the War of 1812

**Explain the differences between Interpretation A and Interpretation B**

Document A argues that there were specific material and political motivations for the War of 1812. Among these are the political demands for Britain to be expelled from Canada, the goals of the various factions within the Democratic-Republican party all vying for power, and territorial expansion of the US. On the other hand, Document B condemns materialistic explanations of the war, instead arguing that ideas of "honor" and "integrity of the nation" were rife and that the people believed the war needed to be fought to avoid humiliation.

**Specific Historical Evidence to Support Interpretation A**

Trade did play a significant role in motivating the War of 1812. The US "depended upon the free flow of shipping across the Atlantic", and that access to European goods was a crucial aspect of the economy. The War of 1812 sought to repair the relationship with Britain and resolve the disputes, improving trade in the long run. 

Additionally, the Americans saw Tecumseh rallying the Indians in opposition to their settlers, challenging the idea of Manifest Destiny, so seeking to gain lands, they actively fought against the Native Americans, which led to fighting with the British. Felix Grundy, a prominent War Hawk in a Speech to the House of Representatives says "My mind is irresistibly drawn the toe West", considering the "very soil" the Indians live on as "tenants" is at the "sufferance" of the US. Clearly, materialistic territorial expansion was an important aspect to the war.

**Specific Historical Evidence to Support Interpretation B**

Risjord argues that the Americans saw themselves as protecting their honor during the war of 1812. This can be seen in James Madison's War Message to Congress, where he describes the "injuries and indignities" being "heaped on our country". "Indignities", not being material, but rather an insult to the integrity of America. Specifically,  he says that put in a similar situation, Britain would be "prompt to avenge" themselves had they been subject to such "insulting pretensions". Clearly, Madison saw this as more as America gaining its rights as a nation and responding to insult, rather than a calculated play to gain land or political power.
