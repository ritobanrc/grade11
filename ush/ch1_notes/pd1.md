## Reflection on excerpt from "An Indigenous People's History"


Dunbar-Ortiz sets out to tell the story of indigenous people in America, and deconstruct the common narratives, even the ones that may not appear as pernicious. For example, it's often ignored that governments and institutions actively sought to perpetuate ideas like the Doctrine of Discovery (pg. 4-5), the idea that Europeans fundamentally had the right to settle on land already occupied by Native Americans. It is important to recognize that this doctrine was imposed by the church and actively encouraged by the US government, like in the Continental Congress's Northwest Ordinance. Recognizing the institutions that instituted the blatantly unjust policies can allow us to spot similarly insidious actions today. She brings up another example, this time seemingly merely a rhetorical tendency: the idea that the "first" of something only counts when it was done by European settlers (pg. 14). Once again, an awareness of these tendencies can cause us to ignore indigenous issues, still affecting policy and attitudes today.
