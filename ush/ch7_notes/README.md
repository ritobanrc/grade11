# Ch 7. The Age of Jefferson
* "We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists"

## Loyalty with an Olive Branch
* Kept Hamilton's National Bank + debt repayment plan
    - "Olive Branch"
* Maintained Neutrality
* Limited Central Govt.
    - Reduced military size
    - Reduce federal jobs
    - Repeal excise taxes (from Adams and Washington, incl. whiskey)
    - Lowered National Debt
* Only nominated Dem-Reps to cabinet to avoid internal dissent

### Louisiana Purchase
* Remember _Pickney Treaty_ -- treaty with Spain
    - Spain has Louisiana Territory and New Orleans
    - Allowed US access to Port of New Orleans + Mississippi
* Napoleon is trying to conquer the world right now
    - Forces Spain to give hem Louisiana Territory
    - Currently fighting with England, using lots of resources
    - Haitian revolt → France really short on resources
* Spanish revoke _right of deposit_ in Pickney Treaty → Jefferson is worried
    - Settlers west (Indiana) were expecting, relying on Mississippi
    - Jefferson sends ambassadors to Napoleon w/ 10 mn for **Port of New Orleans**
    - Plan B: Alliance with English, try to defeat Napoleon
    - Napoleon offers _entire Louisiana territory_ for **15 mn**
        * Insane, 3c / acre

* **Constitutional Problem**
    - Constitution doesn't explicitly say president can buy land
    - Jefferson is strict constitutionalist → Dilemma with himself
* Puts idealism aside, decides its better for the country if he buys the land
    - Decides its ok based on Presidential power to make treaties
    - Federalists attack him, he's reneging on his ideals
    - Backfires on the Federalists, looks like they don't want free land 

* **Consequences**
    - Doubled the size of the US, extended western frontier
    - Supported Jefferson's ideal of **independent farmers**
    - Federalists look weak
* **Lewis and Clark**
    - Led by Captain **Meriwether Lewis** and Lieutenant **William Clark**
    - Scientific exploration, from St. Louis to Oregon Coast
    - Better maps -- map out the western US

## John Marshall and SCOTUS
* Appointed by Adams, served for 34 years, strengthened central govt.
* Adams packed the courts before leaving w/ Federalists: _"midnight appointments"_

### Marbury v. Madison
- **William Marbury**, midnight appointment promised a seat by Adams
- Madison has to give Judges commission, Jefferson instructs Madison not to
* Goes to Supreme Court
* Chief Justice **John Marshall** (Jefferon's cousin)
    - Judiciary Act says Marbury has the commission
    - But Marshall says, _Judiciary Act_ as a whole is unconstitutional
* Establishes "Judicial Review" -- SCOTUS rules don't just apply to the specific case, they set the interpretation for the _entire country_ 
    - Supreme Court effectively gets _Power to create law_
    - Vastly Expands power of Federal government -- Democratic-Republicans fucked up

### Judicial Impeachments
* Suspended Alien and Sedition Acts
* Jefferson supported impeaching federalist judgges
    - Samuel Chase impeached but acquitted 
    - Another district court judge found "mentally unbalanced" 

## Jefferson's Re-election
* **Aaron Burr**: VP in first term
    - Democratic-Republican caucus chooses not to run him again
* Federalist Conspiracy
    - Burr plans to win NY governor, and then lead NE to secede
    - Hamilton opposes Burr
    - Hamilton finds out, calls him out 
    - _Duel_ 
    - Hamilton dies 
    - Burr tries flees to Mexico and possibly unite it with US? 
    - Jefferson arrets Burr and sends to Trial 
    - Marshall acquits Burr

* Also challenges from "Quids", Republican opponents of Jefferson

### Foreign Policy
* Goal: Reduce size of military 
    - Doesn't want military to turn against citizens
    - Also Saves money, lowers national debt
* Washington and Adams paid tribute to **Barbary governments** to protect US merchant ships 
    - Pasha of Tripoli increases the tribute
    - Jefferson doesn't like this, sends naval fleet to island of Tripoli
    - No decisive military victory, realizes that US can't win on open sea (Navy not large enough)
    - Challenges idea of "small military"
* Challenges to Neutrality
    - Britain and France
    - Naval blockades
    - Seized neutral ships, confiscated cargo
    - Impressment is a problem
    - Mostly Britain
* **Chesapeake-Leopard Affair**
    - Leopard (British Ship) attack Chesapeake (American Ship)
        - British deserters on the Chesapeake
    - Jefferson almost declares war (testing American Neutrality)
    - Instead decides on **Embargo of 1807**
        - Stops all trade with British Merchants
        - Backfires, Leads to _depression_ and unrest
        - Britain just moves to South America

## Madison Presidency
> Wherever the real power in Government lies, there is a danger of oppression -- James Madison, Letter to Jefferson, 1788

* Madison is short (5' 4") and not particularly charismatic (not a good public speaker)

### The Election of 1808
* Nominated with Jefferson's help
    - Other factions of Republicans nominated other candidates
* Defeats Pinckney and the rest
* Federalists gain seats in congress, unhappiness over embargo

### Commerical Warfare
* Nonintercourse Act (1809)
    - Eliminates Embargo Act for everyone except Britain and France
* _**Macon**'s Bill No. 2_
    - Would restore trade with _either_ Britain or France
    - Whichever agrees to respect American Neutrality gets to trade, other one doesn't 
* Napoleon's Deception
    - Napoleon says he'll agree
    - US embargoes trade with Britain
    - Napoleon continues to seize merchant ships


### War Hawks
* New wave of anti-European congresspeople
    - John C. Calhoun, Henry Clay

### Declaration of War
* We reach a boiling point -- Madison caves under pressure, declares war 
* Britain actually decides shortly before the war to remove naval blockade

* **In favor of War**: Pennsylvania, Vermont, South, and West (want to expand territory)
* **Opposed to War**: New York, New Jersey, rest of New England (stronger ties to England, War hurts trade)
    * DeWitt Clinton (NY, Federalist opposition)
    * Called "Mr. Madison's War"  
    * "Quids" -- old Democratic-Republicans who don't want to get involved in war

### The War of 1812
* Invasion of Canada
    - Economic and Political opportunity 
    - Try a 3 part invasion (Detroit, Niagra, Lake Champlain), but it's poorly coordinated
    - It fails, except a couple of Canadian govt. buildings burned
    - Leads to more British retaliation
* Naval Battles
    - Some victories (NE shipbuilding)
    - _Constiution_ sinks a British ship
    - Privateers also capture some British ships
    - But British blockade → reduced trade
    - _Lake Eerie_
        - **Captain Oliver Hazard Perry** declares victory after 3 hours
    - _Battle of Thames River_
        - **General William Henry Harrison** wins
        - Tecumseh killed
* Chesapeake Campaign
    - Napoleon defeated → British focus on America
    - British march into D.C, burn white house, Capitol
    - Fail to take Fort McHenry (Star Spangled Banner)
* Southern Campaign
    - **General Andrew JAckson**
    - _Battle of Horseshoe Bend_ (Alabama)
        * Eliminate Creek nation (British ally) 
        * More lands for settlers 
    - British blocked at New Orleans (but after Treaty of Ghent)

### Treaty of Ghent (1814)
* Effectively stalemate
* No more fighting, return of all territory, revert US-Canada border
* Doesn't resolve impressment or naval blockage

### The Hartford Convention
* Federalist Party meet in Hartford to threaten succession
    - Policy rejected, but still painted as traitors
* Try to weaken Dem-Reps 

### The Legacy
* US Gained respect
* Canada conceded to British
* Federalists dead
* Talk of succession -- precedent for the South
* Native Americans surrender more land
* Naval Blockade → US factories, more industrial
* Andrew Jackson + William Henry Harrison gain fame and recognition, eventually become president
* Nationalism grew
