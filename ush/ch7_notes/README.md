# Ch 7. The Age of Jefferson

## Loyalty with an Olive Branch
* Kept Hamilton's National Bank
    - "Olive Branch"
* Limited Central Govt.
    - Reduced military size
    - Reduce federal jobs
    - Repeal excise taxes (from Adams and Washington)
    - Lowered National Debt

### Louisiana Purchase
* Remember _Pickney Treaty_ -- treaty with Spain
    - Allowed US access to Port of New Orleans + Mississippi
* Napoleon is trying to conquer the world right now
    - Has a large plot of land in western US
    - Currently fighting with England, using lots of resources
    - Haitian revolt → France really short on resources
* Spanish revoke Pickney Treaty → Jefferson is worried
    - Settlers west were expecting, relying on Mississippi
    - Jefferson sends ambassadors to Napoleon w/ 10 mn for Port of New Orleans
    - Plan B: Alliance with English, try to defeat Napoleon
    - Napoleon offers _entire Louisiana territory_ for **15 mn**
        * Insane, 3c / acre

* **Constitutional Problem**
    - Constitution doesn't explicitly say president can buy land
    - Jefferson is strict constitutionalist → Dilemma with himself
* Puts idealism aside, decides its better for the country if he buys the land
    - Federalists attack him, he's reneging on his ideals
    - Backfires on the Federalists, looks like they don't want free land 

* **Consequences**
    - Doubled the size of the US, extended western frontier
    - Supported Jefferson's ideal of **independent farmers**
    - Federalists look weak
* **Lewis and Clark**
    - Scientific exploration, from St. Louis to Oregon Frontier
    - Better maps -- map out the western US

## John Marshall and SCOTUS
* Adams packed the courts before leaving w/ Federalists: _"midnight appointments"_
    - **William Marbury** promised a seat by Adams
    - Madison has to give Judges comission, Jefferson instructs Madison not to
* Goes to Supreme Court
* Chief Justice **John Marshall** (Jefferon's cousin)
    - Judiciary Act says Marbury has the commission
    - But Marshal says, _Judiciary Act_ as a whole is unconstitutional
* "Judicial Review" -- SCOTUS rules don't just apply to the specific case, they set the interpretation for the _entire country_ 
    - Supreme Court effectively gets _Power to create law_
    - Vastly Expands power of Federal government -- Democratic-Republicans fucked up

## Jefferson's Re-election
* **Aaron Burr**: VP in first term
    - Democratic-Republican caucus chooses not to run him again
* Federalist Conspiracy
    - Burr makes pact with NE Federalists to secede from nation
    - Hamilton finds out, calls him out → _Duel_ → Hamilton dies → Burr tries flees to Mexico → Jefferson sends Burr to Trial → Marshall acquits Burr

### Foreign Policy
* Goal: Reduce size of military 
    - Doesn't want military to turn against citizens
    - Also Saves money, lowers national debt
* Halts Washington & Adams policy
* Washington and Adams pay tribute to Barbary governments to protect US merchant ships 
    - Jefferson doesn't like this, sends naval fleet to island of Tripoli
    - No decisive military victory, realizes that US can't win on open sea (Navy not large enough)
    - Challenges idea of "small military"
* **Chesapeake-Leopard Affair**
    - Leopard (British Ship) attack Chesapeake (American Ship)
        - British deserters on the Chesapeake
    - Jefferson almost declares war (testing American Neutrality)
    - Instead decides on **Embargo of 1807**
        - Stops all trade with British Merchants
        - Backfires, Leads to _depression_ and unrest

## Madison Presidency
> Wherever the real power in Government lies, there is a danger of oppression -- James Madison, Letter to Jefferson, 1788

* Madison is short (5' 4") and not particularly charismatic (not a good public speaker)

### Commerical Warfare
* Nonintercourse Act (1809)
    - Eliminates Embargo Act for everyone except Britain and France
* _**Macon**'s Bill No. 2_
    - Would restore trade with _either_ Britain or France
    - Whichever agrees to respect American Neutrality gets to trade, other one doesn't 
* Napoleon's Deception

### War Hawks
* New wave of anti-European congresspeople
    - John C. Calhoun, Henry Clay

### Declaration of War
* We reach a boiling point -- Madison caves under pressure, declares war 
* Britain actually decides shortly before the war to remove naval blockade

* **In favor of War**: Pennsylvania, Vermont, South, and West (want to expand territory)
* **Opposed to War**: New York, New Jersey, rest of New England (stronger ties to England, War hurts trade)
    * DeWitt Clinton (NY, Federalist opposition)
    * Called "Mr. Madison's War"  
    * "Quids" -- old Democratic-Republicans who don't want to get involved in war

### The War of 1812
* Invasion of Canada
    - Economic and Political opportunity 
    - Try a 3 part invasion, but it's poorly coordinated
    - It fails
    - British still have army in the US -- even manage to burn down white house
* Naval Battles
    - These are pretty even
    - Lake Eerie
    - Battle of New Orleans → Andrew Jackson becoming popular

### Treaty of Ghent (1814)
* Effectively stalemate
* No more fighting, trade would continue
* Doesn't resolve impressment or naval blockage

### The Hardford Convention
* Federalist Party meet in Hartford to threaten succession
    - Policy rejected, but still painted as traitors
* Try to weaken Dem-Reps 

### The Legacy
* US Gained respect
* Canada conceded to British
* Federalists dead
* Talk of succession -- precedent for the South
* Native Americans surrender more land
* Naval Blockade → US factories, more industrial
* Andrew Jackson + William Henry Harrison gain fame and recognition, eventually become president
* Nationalism grew
