**Explain how the new market economy, the rise of cotton production, and slavery led to sectional crisis in the early to mid 19th century.**

Sectional crises in the early to mid 19th century in America had several causes. Although early on during the Era of Good Feelings, America had a one party system, disagreements soon emerged. In the south, the new market economy facilitated the created of large plantations, and technological advancements like the cotton gin and textile mill lead to massive increases in the growth of cotton production, as America became the British cloth industry's primary supplier. However, these plantations used slave labor, which became a major point of tension between the North and the South. As other countries, like Britain, began to outlaw slavery, the Northern US, as well as the Southern mountain men like Andrew Jackson, became increasingly hostile to it. Additionally, slavery limited the availability and efficacy of free labor, as immigrants, particularly from Ireland, came to New York, Boston, and Philadelphia and started getting involved with politics. Altogether, the material interests of different groups in the country became wildly disparate, as the southern aristocracy doubled down on slavery and northern immigrants and factory owners vied for the growth of free labor.
