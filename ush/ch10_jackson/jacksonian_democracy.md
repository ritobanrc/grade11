# Jacksonian Democracy

## The Rise of a Democratic Society
* **Alexis de Tocquevlle** (French aristocrat)
    - Impressed at lack of class (rich and poor share amenities, wear similar clothing)
* Belief in equality of opportunity (for white males)

## Politics of the Common Man
* Lower & middle class start to vote (7x as much as before)
* Causes:
    - State-level suffrage laws
    - Campaigning changes
    - Improved Education
    - Newspapers

### Causes of Jacksonian Democracy
* **Universal male suffrage**
    - Indiana, Illinois, Missouri allow all males to vote/hold office
    - No religious/property requirements → expand to lower/middle class
    - Remaining state follow
* **Party nominating conventions**
    - "nominating conventions" replace "King Causes" (private meeting among party higher-ups)
        - Basically just large meetings
* **Popular election of the president**: Replace choosing electors based on legislature w/ popular vote
* **Two-party system**: Campaigns on a national scale → large political parties
* **Rise of third parties**:
    - Anti-Masonic party
    - Workingmen's Party
    - Access untapped voters
* **More elected offices**: More state/local officials
* **Popular campaigning**: 
    - Politics is entertainment (parades of floats and marching bands w/ free food)
    - More personal attacks
* **Spoils system and rotation of officeholders**
    - **Spoils system**: Jackson nominates _only_ loyal Democrats. CORRUPTION! YAY!
    - System of rotation (max 1 term) to maximize number of democrats
        * _contempt for experts_ (anyone can be an officeholder)

## Jackson v. Adams

### Election of 1824

    - Andrew Jackson
    - **John Quincy Adams**
    - Henry Clay
    - William Crawford
* Quincy Adams Wins!
    - But no one wins _majority_ of electoral college/popular vote
    - Jackson wins plurality popular vote
    - But House of Representatives gives it to Quincy Adams!
        - Henry Clay supports Quincy Adams
        - Quincy Adams gives Clay Secretary of State

### President John Quincy Adams
* Quincy Adams Presidency
    - Pretty boring
    - Asks congress for money for internal investment, National Observatory, National University
    - Seemed elitist, needs high taxes, violation of Constitution
* _tariff of abominations_ (1828), helps northern manufacturers
* Seems like a Betrayal of Democracy

## Jackson's Victory, Growing Sectionalism
* 1828, **Andrew Jackson** wins presidency by huge margin
    - Simplistic, popular ideas
        * Also pushed forward by unpopular tariff introduced by Quincy
        * Tariff supported northern merchants, but hurt southern farmers
    - Prospector, buying and selling lands
    - Called _Old Hickory_, because of gritty nature, "tough guy"
    - Symbolized the "working man", western frontier, souther states

    - accuses Jackson's wife of adultery
    - 3x as many voters
* VP: Calhoun

### Indian Removal Act
* _Trail of Tears_
* Focussed on westward expansion
    - Wanted more territory -- would help his election chances
    - But there's Indians there!
* Native Americans had largely assimilated into American society
    - But still faced pressure from whites to drive the Indians out
    - Jackson wants to remove the Native Americans
* US Military Rounded up 15,000 Cherokee's
    - By land and sea, moved them to modern day Oklahoma (west of Mississippi)
        * Forced along like cattle with bayonets

### Nullification Crisis
* Jackson favors states rights generally, but prioritizes unity
    - S.C. Legislature declares "Tarriff of Abominations" unconstitutional
    - _nullification theory_: Idea that each state can choose whether to obey or disobey a federal law
        * Supported by John C. Calhoun
* Debate between Daniel Webster (Mass.) and Robert Hayne (S.C.)
    - Jackson reponds "Our federal union, it must be preserved" 
    - Calhoun disagrees, "The Union, next to our liberties, most dear"
* S.C. holds special convention to nullify all tarriffs
    - Jackson prepares for military action, gets Congress to authorize (Force bill)
    - Declares nullification = treason
    - Congress manages to compromise by lowering tariff, nullification rescinded
* **Jackson used executive order to stop antislavery literature from being shared through the mail!**

### Jackson's Financial Reform
* Jackson doesn't like Bank of the United States
    - Too much power in hands of private banks
    - Private banks handling public money
    - Argues it's unconstitutional
        * Henry Clay supports it, Congress passes re-charter bill
        * Jackson vetos → people support jackson

### Texas Independence w/o Annexation
* Texas belonged to Mexico
    - Mexican revolution happened earlier
* American settlers allowed to farm in Texas
    - But Mexican government didn't like slaves
    - American Settlers didn't like Mexican regulations (getting rid of slavery)
        - Sam Houston
* American Settlers rebel, declare independence, create "Republic of Texas"
    - Ask to join US
    - Denied, Jackson refuses to upset Slave/Free states
    - So Texas is independent!

    - Response to Jacksonian Democrats
    - Representative of Northeast, New England merchants, business
    - Anti-immigrant
    - Support Clay's American system (central government investment)
    - Dislike immigrants

    - So Whigs end up winning
