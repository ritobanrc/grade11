# Ch 10. The Age of Jackson (1824-1844)

## Jackson v. Trump
Both Trump and Jackson presented themselves as the "man of the people", and had their support concentrated in similar areas -- the south and Appalachia. Both Trump and Jackson's "man of the people" presentation is spurious, both having backgrounds in land trading, Trump being a billionaire son of a wealthy millionaire landowner, and Jackson being a land prospector. While Jackson's case may be slightly stronger, because of his military service, which Trump lacks, Jackson was a general, and it's hard to argue that he was purely an "ordinary person". Both Trump and Jackson's populism engages in an Us vs. Them categorization, with Trump demonizing illegal immigrants and Jackson demonizing Native Americans. Both flaunted Supreme Court Rulings with respect to this categorization, with Trump ignoring SCOTUS on DACA, and Jackson ignoring John Marshall's ruling on the Trail of Tears. However, at the time, Jackson's policies were far more popular and less divisive than Trump's are today. Trump is much father beyond the pail than Jackson. 

# Democracy in America (1815 - 1840)
* Notes taken from _Give Me Liberty_ Ch. 10
* **Jackson's Inauguration**
    - Previously, Inaugurations small, dignified
    - For Jackson, 20k people in White House, break glass, china, etc.
    - Justice Story calls it "Reign of King Mob"
    - Represents Jackson's populist appeal
* **Jackson's Supporters and Detractors**
    - Supporters: Jackson represents "common man", extremely popular
    - Detractors: Consider him a tyrant, "King Andrew I", name themselves "Whigs" (opposition to royals in England)
* **Jackson's Background**
    - Self-made man


## The Triumph of Democracy
* **Property and Democracy**
    - Original 13 states required property to vote, but later states did not
    - Over time, property requirements were slowly abolished
* **The Dorr War**
    - Rhode Island reformers organize a _People's Convention_, draft a new state constitution w/ universal white male suffrage
    - Reformers "elect" Thomas Dorr as governor
    - John Tyler sends in Federal troops, Dorr convicted of treason
* **Tocqueville on Democracy**
    - _Alexis de Tocqueville_: French writer who writes _Democracy In America_
    - Declares that American democracy has been extremely successful
    - Points to individual action in politics, how people _felt_ like they were part of democracy
* **The Information Revolution**
    - New democratic tendencies spark a change in the way information is disseminated
    - Steam power leads to more availability of newspapers, other printed material
    - Newspapers pick sides in politics, support political parties
    - General explosion in printed materials, incl. magazines and guidebooks and novels
    - New Women writers, including Catharine Beecher, Harriet Beecher Stowe (_The American Woman's Home_, a guide to domestic life)
        * Precursor to the antebellum reform movement
* **The Limits of Democracy**
    - Generally, democracy has grown to include all white men, including poor and immigrants
    - However, women and Black people very deliberately excluded as inferior
* **A Racial Democracy**
    - Tocqueville observes egalitarianism, lack of aristocracy in America 
    - Racist imagery grows -- minstrel shows portray Black people as stupid, superstitious, and (ironically), hyper-religious
    - Initially Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia explicitly prohibit Black voting, other states just make it hard -- but over time, new states did not extend franchise to Black people, and some states even rescinded it
* **Race and Class**
    - _Thaddeus Stevents_: White advocate for civil rights, refuses to sign Pennsylvania 1837 constitution because it denies voting rights to Black people
    - Black people denied participation in State militias, army, public schools
    - Race is the new marker for democratic participation
    - Notably, white male immigrants can vote almost immediately

## Nationalism and its Discontents
* **The American System**
    - Movement following War of 1812 Led by _Henry Clay_ and _John C. Calhoun_
    - Focusses on Protecting American industry
    - Three parts: (1) a new national bank, (2) tariff on manufactured goods, (3) federal investment in roads and canals
    - _James Madison_ initially supports this American system
    - But ends up voting (3) because of constitutional concerns
* **Banks and Money**
    - Banks generally resented by the people for being "nonproducers"
    - Money must be backed by gold or silver ("specie")
    - Hundreds of new banks, some of them print more than they have, leads to massive fluctuations in the value of paper money
    - Bank of the United States created to regulate everything, prevent overissuance of money
        * Granted power to suspend local banks if they cannot produce specie
* **The Panic of 1819**
    - Bank of the United States engages in speculation
    - Massive supply of land in the west → Demand for loans →  Bank tries to print more money
    - Economic bubble bursts, speculators lose millions, Bank asks for loan repayments, leads to bankruptcy and unemployment
* **The Politics of the Panic**
    - Expands distrust of banks
    - Many states suspend debt collection, Kentucky creates state bank which prints paper money
    - Several states try to tax the bank → _McCulloc v. Maryland_, where John Marshall declares this is unconstitutional
* **The Missouri Controversy**
    - _James Monroe_ comes to power in 1816, wins in a landslide in 1820
