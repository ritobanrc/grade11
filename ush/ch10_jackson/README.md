# Ch 10. The Age of Jackson (1824-1844)

* Populism! Age of the "Common Man", Era of Jacksonian Democracy
    - Political opportunist

## Jackson v. Trump
Both Trump and Jackson presented themselves as the "man of the people", and had their support concentrated in similar areas -- the south and Appalachia. Both Trump and Jackson's "man of the people" presentation is spurious, both having backgrounds in land trading, Trump being a billionaire son of a wealthy millionaire landowner, and Jackson being a land prospector. While Jackson's case may be slightly stronger, because of his military service, which Trump lacks, Jackson was a general, and it's hard to argue that he was purely an "ordinary person". Both Trump and Jackson's populism engages in an Us vs. Them categorization, with Trump demonizing illegal immigrants and Jackson demonizing Native Americans. Both flaunted Supreme Court Rulings with respect to this categorization, with Trump ignoring SCOTUS on DACA, and Jackson ignoring John Marshall's ruling on the Trail of Tears. However, at the time, Jackson's policies were far more popular and less divisive than Trump's are today. Trump is much father beyond the pail than Jackson.
