# Ch 19. The Gilded Age
* Population increasing (39 mn people by 1870), due to immigration
    - Third largest western nation (behind Russia and France)
* After Reconstruction in 60s and 70s
    - Rutherford B. Hayes, Compromise of 1877 ends Reconstruction
    - Stalemate in politics
* Disillusionment among young Americans -- didn't get political reforms

## Politics in the Gilded Age
* _Gilded Age_ coined by Mark Twain
    - Superficial glitter of new wealth
    - Unremarkable president (none served 2 terms), politicians ignore problems

### Causes of Stalemate
* **Belief in limited government**
    - Came from **laissez-faire economics** and **social Darwinism**
    - **Courts limited government** power to regulate Business (Lochner era, "freedom of contract")
* **Campaign tactics**
    - Close elections (1876 and 1892) → **Parties try to be moderate**
    - Dems win 2 electoral college despite 4 popular vote, control HoR in 8/10 general elections
    - Campaigning features: **brass bands, flags, buttons, picnics, free shit**
    - Republicans = State-wide, Democrats = URban
    - Strong party loyalty → 80% Turnout
    - **Republicans focus on "bloody shirt"** (representative of wounds caused by the south in Civil War)
        * Reformers and African Americans
        * Businessmen, Middle Class Protestants (Whig ideas, high tariffs, temperance/prohibition)
    - **Democrats consistently win South**
        - Immigrants
        - More Catholics, Lutherans, and Jews (objected to temperance/prohibition)
        - Political machines
    - **Both (nominally) believe in "states rights"**, avoid doing anything
* **Patronage**
    - Giving office to party loyalists
    - **Stalwarts**: Support spoils system
        - _Roscoe Conkling (R)_ dictated who could be appointed to NY Customs House (**Stalwarts**)
    - **Half-breeds**: civil service reform (_James G. Blaine_)
    - **Mugwumps**: young liberal reformers, anti-corruption, opposed patronage
        - mugs on one side of fence, wumps on the other??

### Presidential Politics
* **Rutherford B. Hayes**
    - _Compromise of 1877_: ended reconstruction (withdraw last troops from South), only serve 1 term
    - Supported temperance ("Lemonade Lucy", stopped alcohol in WH)
    - Vetoed Chinese immigration restrictions
    - Tried to avoid corruption
* **James Garfield** (Arthur as VP)
    - Half-Breed Republican (Hayes's lack of corruption was becoming inconvenient)
    - Dems nominate Hancock (former Union general), lose in close election
    - 100k Republicans ask Garfield for jobs, picks mostly Halfbreeds, Stalwarts mad
    - Assassinated in 1881
* **Chester A. Arthur** 
    * Initially, Stalwart Republican
        - Pulled away and advocated civil service reform
    * Developed a Navy
    * Questioned high protective tariff
    * Wasn't renominated

### Congressional Leaders
* _John Sherman_ (brother of famous General)
    - Let his name be attached to **Sherman Antitrust Act**
* _Thomas  "Czar" Reed"_ (Speaker of House)
* _James G. Blaine_ (Sen. Maine), reshape Republicans from anti-slavery into pro-business
    * Hurt by Railroad scandals + corruption

### Election of 1884
* James Blaine (R) vs Grover Cleveland (D)
    - Mugwumps don't like Blaine, some switch to Cleveland
* Cleveland is "incorruptible"
* (except) Rumors of Cleveland's illegitimate child
    - Labeled "Rum, Romanism Rebellion"
    - Angered Irish  Catholics, voted in bigger numbers, first Dem since pre-Lincoln

### Grover Cleveland (1st Term)
* Frugal, small government
* **Pendleton Act**: civil service reform
    - Outrage of assassination of Garfield → Congress remove some jobs from party control (called "classified", over time, includes nearly all jobs)
    - _Civil Service Commission_: Applicants selected based on exam
    - Civil servants cannot make political contributions
    - Politicians turn to rich corporations for funding
* Vetoed false pensions??
* **Interstate Commerce Act 1887**: First attempt to regulate business
* **Dawes Act**: Subdivided Native American land to individuals
* Retrieved 81 mn acres of govt. land

### Economic Issues
- Debtors, farmers, start-ups want more money (lower interest rates, pay off loans more easily due to inflation)
    - _Panic of 1873_ → Blame on Gold Standard (it restricts money supply)
    - Advocate for paper money ("green backs"), and unlimited silver coins
- Banks, creditors, investors, established businesses want hard money (gold standard)
    - Hold value despite inflation, as population increases, value of dollar increases (as it already had)
- **Greenback party**
    - Paper money had been issued during Civil war, helped northern farmers
    - 1875, _Specie (gold/silver) Resumption Act_, remove last greenbacks from circulation
    - Form Greenback party, 1 mn votes, 14 members of Congress (incl. **James B. Weaver**)
    - Doesn't last very long
- **Silver**
    - Stops coining of Silver 1873
    - Silver found in Nevada, **Bland-Allison Act**, veto-ovveride Hayes, allows $2-4 mn silver/month, maintain ratio of 16:1 silver to gold
    - Farmers/debtors/poor/startups still want _unlimited_ silver
- **Tariff Issues**
    - Republicans want high tariff, southern & some northern democrats oppose
    - Other nations respond in kind → American farmers lose overseas market → Corn + wheat surplus → Lower profits

## The Growth of Discontent
* People dislike corruption
* Populist party + Panic of 1893 → Some Change

### Benjamin Harrison (R)
* Cleveland challenges high tariff at the end (surplus in treasury), it's a real issue!
* **Election of 1888**
    - Dems support Cleveland, Reps support Harrison's High tariff
    - Businesses and Veterans support Harrison because of tariff and pensions
    - Cleveland wins popular vote, Harrison wins electoral college

    - Republicans control government
    - **McKinley Tariff**: Raise tariff to 48%
    - **Increase Monthly Pensions** to Vets, widows, children
    - **Sherman Antitrust Act**: outlaws monoplization
    - **Sherman Silver Purchase Act**: Increase coinage of silver, but not very much
    - **Voting rights of African Americans** (defeated in the Senate)
* **Return of the Dems**
    - Dems regain congress in 1890, largely due to seats in MIdwest
    - Reaction to prohibition and Sunday closing laws passed by States

### Rise of the Populists
* Growing agrarian discontent
* **Omaha platform**
    - Farmers' Alliances form **Populist Party**

* **Election of 1892**
    - _James Weaver_ (Populist presidential candidate), 1mn votes, 22 electoral votes
    - But he's 3rd party, obviously he loses
    - Harrison v. Cleveland, Cleveland wins (no one likes McKinley Tariff), only president to be re-elected after losing

### Depression politics
* **Panic of 1893**
    - Overspeculation → railroad companies bankrupt → 4 year depression
    - Farm foreclosures, 20% unemployment
    - Cleveland repeals _Sherman silver purchase act_, returns to gold standard
* **Gold reserve and tariff**

    - Washington supports rich (bailed out the bankers)
* **Wilson-Gorman Tariff**
    - Reduce tariff
    - Cleveland passes 2% income tax on more than $2k
    - SCOTUS declares unconstitutional

    - Arrested for trespassing
* **Coin's Financial School** 
    - Book by _William H. Harvey_

## Turning Point in 1896
* Conservative Democrats Discredited by Cleveland

### Election of 1896

    - _Mark Hanna_ funds McKinley's campaign
    - Dems blamed for Panic of 1893
* **Campaign**
    - Bryan gives 600 speeches
    - Hanna raises money from business leaders, uses newspapers and magazines to win
    - Bryan loses due to 
        - rise in wheat prices (farmers less deparate)
        - fearmongering about shutting down factories
    - McKinley wins Northeast, upper Midwest

### McKinley's Presidency
* Economy getting better
* Gold discovered in Alaska → inflation → gold standard isn't as bad for farmers/debtors
* **Dingley Tariff**, return to gold standard 
* **Spanish-American War**

### Significance of Election of 1896
* Ended Gilded Age stagnation
* Republican (party of business, industry, strong government) dominance
* **Populist demise**
    - Dead
    - Thomas Watson fails to unite poor whites and blacks (cause people are racist, regardless of economic interests)
    - Income tax + popular election adopted during Progressive Era
* **Urban dominance**: Victory for big business and urban industry > rural farmers
* **Beginning of international politics**: US joins international politics
