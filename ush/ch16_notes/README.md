# Ch 16. The Last West and the New South

## The West: Settlement of the Last Frontier
* Americans have no more land to conquer
    - They've reached the western coast
* _Frederick Jackson Turner_ asks: 
    - The history of America is conquering the frontier
    - What do we do now? What do you do when you've conquered the world?

## The Great American Desert
* Inhabited for hundreds of years by nomadic Native American groups
    - Hunting buffalo
    - The land is _extremely_ infertile
    - 250k American Indians
* Pre-war, was largely passed over
* By 1900,
    - Bison wiped out
    - Divided by railroads
    - Indian forced onto reservations

## The Mining Frontier
* What was bringing people over?
* Gold discovered in CA (1848)
    - Simple tools (shovels/pans)
    - Development of mining towns, saloons, dance-halls, vigilante justice (cowboys) 
    - Gold/silver influx → inflation
* Immigrants: faced racism, prejudice
    - 1/3 of miners Chinese, despite **Foreign miners tax $20/month**
    - **Chinese Exclusion Act**: Exclude immigration on race/nationality

### Chinese Exclusion Act
* Started in 1840, largely in San Fransisco area
* 1850s in China
    - **Second Opium War**
    - Famine, crop failure
* Transcontinental Railroad    
    - Central Pacific built railroad from San Fransisco
    - Largely used Chinese immigrants
    - Work in the West is _a lot_ harder than East
        * Longer hours, more treacherous conditions (Donner pass), lower pay
        * Pay their own food, clothing, housing, and tax
* The Act
    - Complete restriction on immigration

### Primary Sources: Chinese Exclusion Act
* Document A: _Pioneer Laundry Workers Assembly_ (a Union part of the Knights of Labor)
    - Blames Chinese people for job losses
    - They frame businesses as "job creators", which "employ a vast number of women", portray Chinese as "animal[s]" who "steal" jobs
    - My thoughts: _just let Chinese people into your union_
* Document B: New York Herald
    - Focus on Panic of 1873
    - Scapegoating 
* Document C: California Attorney General (Congressional Testimony)
    - A really racist rant
    - "Conflict with labor interests"
    - "can never assimilate"
    - "degrading and demoralizing"
* Document D: Letter from Wong Ar Chong to William Lloyd Garrison (arguing against Senator James G. Blaine of Maine)
    - Systematically deconstructs the argument
    - "somewhat lacking in Christian charity"
    - Chinese people pay taxes
    - It's the capitalist's fault people don't have jobs!

## The Cattle Frontier
* Cattle ranching becomes extremely lucrative
* _vaqueros_: Mexican cowboys
    - Texas longhorn roamed freely
* Railroads connect cattle towns
* Environmental impacts:
    - Overgrazing → blizzards, droughts → 90% of cattle wiped out
    - Homesteaders divide up the land
* New technology
    - Want MOAR MEAT
    - Self-reliant cowboy

## The Farming Frontier
* **Homestead Act** (1862)
    - 160 acres for any family farm for 5 years
    - 500k families got it
    - 2.5mn had to pay up and buy the land
* **Problems**
    - Rains, hail, tornados, weather

### Turner's Frontier Thesis
* Historian Frederick Jackson Turner
    - Will America go the same way as Europe?
    - America becoming less rural, more urban, more industrial?

## American Indians
* Dozens of tribes existed 1865
* Being invaded by white settlers
* **Reservations**
    - Jackson's Presidency
    - No one wants this! 
* **Native American Wars**
    - 1866, Sioux War 
    - _Indian Appropriation Act_ -- No longer recognize tribes as independent nations
