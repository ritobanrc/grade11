# Interpretation: Fate of the Confederacy

## Interpretation A
* **The south defeated itself**
* The confederacy failed because their nationalism failed
    - They couldn't reconcile slavery with their worldview
* The strain from battles was just too much
    - The union was completely opposed to slavery
    - The increased guilt from slavery â†’ Southerners to equivocate on slavery
* Souther pride -- honor
    - Southern states wanted to preserve states rights, white supremacy, and honor
    - Managed to secure those -- "claim their share of the victory"
    - "Honor" in a medieval sense -- we will win the war, you will not slander us, etc.
* Slavery ended up being a crutch -- something they couldn't be proud of
    - This was from the bottom up "thousands of individual decisions"
    - Slavery was against their own religious morals

## Interpretation B
* It wasn't nearly as close -- the south could only be on the defensive for so long before they crumble
* It came down to each individual battle -- there isn't an overarching 

### Difference between A and B
Document A argues that the south defeated itself, because of contradictions between the South's religion and culture and it's goal of defending slavery, while Document B argues that it's not nearly as clear cut, and it came down to the indivdual decisions made in battles by the generals. 

### Evidence that supports A
* The south was pressed for money -- they'd tried income taxes, they'd tried progressive taxation. Slavery was their only source of money, and when that was failing, 
    * The south was overwhelmingly agrarian, and this just wasn't tenable for much longer.
    * Republican politicians had invigorated the North's economy with investment in industry. The south saw the North succeeding, and they needed the money desperately. So they had to give up and rejoin the North.
* The diary of the US Senator from South Carolina, Mary Chesnut. She describes how she went to talk to a Protestant minister, "he is not for slavery, he says, he says, he is for freedom, and freedom to govern our own country as we see fit... Every day shows slavery is doomed the world over; for that he thanked God"
* Didn't have a strong central government, the southern politics were ineffectual, and the ideas of states right undermined the idea that the South should be united in the war effort


### Evidence that supports B
* North had better weapons, while the South had better leaders
    - Instead of having a specific cause, he's ambivalent, leaving it as "if things had gone differently, it would have a different outcome"
* Robert E. Lee was a very good general, and led the Confederacy to many victories, though they were primarily on the Virginia front, and the Confederacy didn't do an effective job translating that to other places.

The Confederacy fell, because of internal contradictions in their worldview that made a society based on those ideas untenable. At the forefront of the Civil War was the question of slavery, but as the North industrialized, the South was left behind, and over time, through "thousands of individual decisions", the idea of slavery became less appetizing to the Southerners. This is corroborated in a diary entry from the wife of the US Senator for South Carolina, Mary Chesnut, where she elaborates on how the Southern affinity for religion contradicted slavery, describing a pastor who opposed slavery, instead supporting "freedom to govern our own country". However, this idea of individual states' rights wasn't particularly effective for the south in the Civil War either, as the lack of a central government led to inefficient war strategy, with many of the leaders like Robert E. Lee over extending their forces at Gettysburg and Antietam, and not efficiently distributing them, focusing on areas like Virginia. Finally, the south had an extremely strong culture of honor, and as they started to lose the war, with defeats "fall[ing] like blows on a dead body", the medieval ideas of honor and divine will kicked in, slowly but surely shifting the public conscious to accepting their defeat. Altogether, the contradictions of the Confederacy could never have allowed it to survive, and while their ideas continue to have a disturbing amount of influence, by understanding why they failed before, we can better combat them today.
