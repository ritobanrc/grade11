# What can we learn about historical events using photographs as historical evidence?  

> We studied the photographs by Alexander Gardner of The Battle of Antietam during our activity in class. We discussed the circumstances in which he photographed his images and the way it was perceived by the public and after. When answering this question, think about events in US history like Vietnam, the War on Terror, or other events where images or videos were easily viewed by the public. Think about the audience the  photographers are trying to reach and inferences the audience can make about the photo. Remember to think about the considerations of the photographer, the limitations, and staging. Please write 6-8 sentences and provide examples.

Photographs provide a crucial piece of history, giving us a visual story that we can't otherwise get through written information. Humans overwhelmingly rely on their visual sense to understand the world, and photographs allow us to use that to understand history. It's because of this unique place that photographs hold that they have so often completely changed history. One picture, of a child's body on banks of Greece, set off the European refugee crises, a political crises that lasted years. The photographs of Abu Ghraib set off a movement, revealing to the world that the CIA was engaging in widespread human rights abuse. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the ways in which a photograph can prey on and elicit emotions is unparalleled in historical evidence. By understanding photographs, we can better understand the popular reaction, and we can better effect political change ourselves today.
