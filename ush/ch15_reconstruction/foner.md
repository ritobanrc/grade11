# The Significant of Reconstruction after the Civil War in American history

Lecture by Historian _Eric Foner_ at the London School of Economics


1. What are some of the parallels that Dr. Foner makes between Reconstruction and current history (e.g. 1990s and early 2000s)?
    * A disputed presidental election (Bush v. Gore compared with Rutherford v. Tilden)
    * Argument about whether African-American rights or female rights are more important (Frederick Douglas and Elizabeth Cady-Stanton, Victoria Woodhull running for president with Douglas as VP compared with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in 2008 Democratic primary)
2. According to Dr. Foner, what are some of the current issues we face that were Reconstruction issues?
    * Political vs Economic Democracy
    * Reparations for Black people (40 acres and a mule, reparations today)
    * Separate but Equal (est. in Plessy v. Ferguson, still applicable today as Black neighborhoods are still largely segregated due to redlining policies)
    * Terrorism (the Ku Klux Klan then, Bin Laden today, and perhaps also more recent right-win terrorism)
3. What does Dr. Foner mean when he says, “Reconstruction is a prime example of what we call the politics of history?”
    * He's referring to the ways in which political views of a time period color the historical interpretations -- specifically referring to the heavily distorted view of reconstruction that prevailed for over 50 years.
4. According to Dr. Foner, what was the “old view” of Reconstruction? Why did it prevail for so long? What is the view on Reconstruction that most if not all historians agree with today?
    * The old view of Reconstruction saw it as a program imposed upon the South by radical Republicans, who gave Black people the right to vote, supposedly leading to chaos and mismanagement. The modern view sees it as a noble effort to establish economic and political equality and democracy, with the tragedy of Reconstruction being that it failed, and that we're still stuck with dealing with it's incompleteness today.
5. According to Dr. Foner, how did slavery shape the definition of citizenship in America before the Civil War?
    * Before the Civil War, citizenship was restricted to people of European descent as established by the Dred Scott v. Sanford decision. The view was the America was a country for whites, and that Black people's only role was to serve them as slaves.
6. According to Dr. Foner, what were some of the problems with the black codes?
    * The Black codes essentially recreated many of the conditions of slavery in the South. They required Black people to be tied down to white employers, and otherwise denied them the right to own property, gather, or really do anything to actually improve their socioeconomic position.
7. Why was the Civil Rights Act of 1866 so radical?
    * For the first time, it defined the concept of citizenship based on birth, rather than race or lineage. Additionally, it codified the idea of equal treatment under the law, which simply did not exist before -- all states had separate laws for their white and black populations. 
8. Why was the 14th amendment so radical? Compare to other amendments prior (e.g. First Amendment).
    * The 14th amendment reframes the relationship between the federal and state governments -- it places the federal government as the protector of liberty, while past amendments saw the primary threat as the federal government overreached and oppressing the state governments. This can specifically be seen in the text of the amendments, where the 1st amendment restricts the power of Congress, beginning with "Congress shall make no law", the 14th ends with "Congress shall have the power".
9. According to Dr. Foner, why did the 15th amendment inaugurate the “radical phase of Reconstruction”?
    * The 15th amendment prohibits federal _and state_ governments from denying the right to vote based on a person's "race, color, or previous condition of servitude". This is the first place where Reconstruction goes from merely fixing the errors of slavery to truly seeking equality. It's where the federal government is placed as the protector of rights and equality.
10. Dr. Foner mentions a colloquy that William T. Sherman had with black ministers in early 1865. How do the leaders of the black ministers define slavery? Explain.
    * They defined slavery as a place where one man takes the labor of another man without consent. They place an almost sacrosanct value on labor, and it's clear that the fundamental issue with slavery is the theft of labor.
11. According to Dr. Foner, why did political democracy move forward but not economic democracy?
    * Political democracy moved forward because the Civil Rights Act and 14th and 15th amendments were passed -- Black people were given the right to vote. Economic democracy, however, did not more forward, as President Johnson immediately abrogated the "40 acres and a mule" program, and essentially left Black people to fend for themselves, unable to gain land or move up socioeconomically, without property, oppressed, and often lynched by the white majority.
12. According to Dr. Foner, how did the Klu Klux Klan help regain power for the southern governments?
    * The Ku Klux Klan re-established Home Rule, or white supremacy, by terrorizing Black people, forcing out the egalitarian Republican governments and instituting the white democratic governments that preserved the power of white people through Jim Crow laws.
13. According to Dr. Foner, what was the new racial system that was implemented at the turn of the century (i.e. 1900)?
    * White supremacy, with Jim Crow laws, segregation, separate-but-equal policies
14. According to Dr. Foner, what are some of the lessons of this Reconstruction history? What are your thoughts on these lessons?
    * Reconstruction shows us how difficult it is to effect meaningful lasting change, and shows us what we need to do to work towards racial equality in the future.
