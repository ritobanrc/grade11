    - Generally wealthier and more conservative, govt. officials and clergy
    - **Native Americans**:

### Initial American Losses and Hardships
* 75-77 went badly, near Disaster in NYC 
    - British have NY and Philly 
    - Camped at **Valley Forge** through the winter 
* British occupy ports → 95% percent decline in trade → no goods, lots of inflation

## Picking up the Pieces
* State governments questioning Continental Congress power
* 10 colonies, w/ different constitutions
    - commonalities incl.:
    - List of Rights, Separation of Powers, Voting, Office Holdings

## Governmental Organization

### State Governments
* Most states already have individual constitution
* w/ Bill of Rights
* Separation of Powers:
    - Legislative, Executive, Judicial
* Voting: All property-owning white males
* Office-holding: Requires even more property

### Articles of Confederation
* Written in Philadelphia, 1776, simultaneous w/ Declaration of Independence
* _John Dickenson_
* Agreement between colonies, adopted 1777
    - Unicameral Congress
    - Each state = 1 vote, 9/13 required for passage
    - Amendments required unanimity
    - **Committee of States**: 1 minor representative per state when full congress not in session
* Dispute over lands west of Alleghenies, but eventually ratified
* Powers:
    * Could wage war, make treaties, diplomacy
    * Borrow money, but not regulate taxes or commerce
* Accomplishments:
    - Won the war
    - **Land Ordinance**: One section of land per township for school 
    - **Northwest Ordinance**: Self government for territory between Great Lakes and Ohio River
        - **Prohibited slavery**
* Problems:
    - **Debt**: War costs money, British wouldn't accept paper money, Congress could not tax colonies, colonies wouldn't donate
    - **Foreign Policy**: America lacked credit, couldn't pay its debt, could not trade with other countries
    - **Shays' Rebellion**: Several farmers, angry with the Massachusetts legislature for increasing taxes, marched on a store of arsenals. The Massachusetts governor dispatched a militia headed by Gen. Benjamin Lincoln who opened fire, causing the rebellion to disperse. 
        - **Connection to AoC**: The Articles of Confederation did not give the central government power to raise taxes and did not provide the means to collect money, though they were still responsible for paying debts. As a result, the Mass. legislature was left with no option other than to tax its poorest farmers. 
        - **Response was divided by class**: Those in higher classes, like General Henry Knox, were scornful of the poor, like Daniel Shays, and were worried that legislatures might start to heed the concerns of the poor, leading to property loss for the wealthy, either as taxes or redistributive policies.
        - **Jefferson's response**: The colonies have been peaceful. Jefferson says Shays' Rebellion is the only example of any unrest. Instead, he's worried that liberties, specifically the right of the people, especially the working classes, to rebel and express dissatisfaction with their government will be curtailed. He thinks freedom to rebel should be important, and rebellions should be somewhat common to keep leaders on their toes and actively resolving problems.
