# Review Questions

1. Describe why the “discovery” of America was one of the “most important
   events recorded in the history of mankind,” according to Adam Smith.
    * Adam Smith described the "discovery" of America as one of the most
      important events because of the incalculable economic potential that the
      discovery of America brought to Europeans, as well as the quite literally
      world-shattering consequences it had for the American natives. For the
      Europeans, America was a land of economic opportunity that could be
      colonized, mined, and farmed for its natural resources. Initially, the
      natives provided a free source of labor, as in the _encomienda_ system,
      but following the decimation of native populations due to diseases
      brought over by the Europeans, African slaves were used as a free source
      of labor to exploit the natural resources. On the other hand, for the
      Native Americans, the arrival of Europeans led to the destruction of
      their civilization and the eventual disappearance of their way of life.
      Because of the sheer magnitude of the consequences of Columbus' arrival
      to America, its one of the "most important events" in recorded history.

2. Using what you read in this chapter about the movement of peoples, explain
   how North America became the location where East and West came together.
    * America was the meeting point for the Eastern Hemisphere (largely Europe)
      and the Western Hemisphere (the Americas) because the first Americans had
      arrived by crossing the Bering Strait during the Ice Age (barring those
      who arrived in boats in South America). After that, they were nomadic for
      several centuries, and settled down much later than their European
      counterparts. As a result, because the Europeans had a head start on them
      in expansion, and developed maritime technology first, they were the ones
      who came to colonize America, instead of the other way around.

3. One of the most striking features of the Native American society at the time
   of European discovery was its sheer diversity. Support this statement.
    * North American society upon European arrival was extremely diverse. In
      the South, the Incans had a large civilization, featuring a comprehensive
      bureacracy, a road network spannign over 2000 miles. Further north, the
      Mayans had developed a written language, a unique numerical system, and
      built pyramids as a center point for both religious and pragmatic
      functions. The Aztecs where replaced the Mayans and built that large city
      of Tenochtitlán, and were unique in their practice of human sacrifice,
      usually prisoners of war.
    * In North America, in the very north, the Inuit people lived near the
      Arctic circle, hunting fish and seals, and living in igloos for shelter.
      Throughout the pacific coast, fishing, especially Salmon fishing was a
      common source of food, and the various tribes featured permanent
      settlements. In the southwest, those permanent settlements were often
      made of adobe, a particular type of brick made from clay that was used to
      build extremely impressive structure. For example, the Hopi built one
      structure which could house over 600 people in 5 floors. In the East,
      woodlands were more common, and food was often obtained through farming,
      hunting, gathering, and fishing. Notable are the organizational
      structures, like the Iroquois Confederacy or Cahokia, a trading center
      near St. Louis. 

4. Compare and contrast European values and ways of life to that of the Indians. Be sure to look at religion, views on property ownership, gender relations, and views of freedom.  

5. What were the main factors fueling the European age of expansion?

6. Describe the political, religious, and economic motivations for Spanish conquest.

7. Compare the political, economic, and religious motivations behind the French and Dutch empires with those of New Spain.

8. Describe how the attitudes and actions of the French and Dutch differed from those of Spain.

9. How would European settlers explain their superiority to Native Americans and justify both the conquest of Native lands and terminating their freedom?

## FREEDOM QUESTIONS
1. Although some European observers believed Native Americans embodied freedom, most reached the conclusion that Native Americans did not know what freedom was because they were “too free.” On what basis did they make this claim?
2. On the eve of colonization, European concepts of freedom bore little resemblance to our modern concepts of personal liberties. Explain how the ideals of “Christian liberty,” obedience to authority, and adhering to one’s social rank shaped the fifteenth century idea of freedom.
3. Spanish and French settlers both claimed to be freeing Native Americans by bringing them advanced civilization and Catholicism. Justify this claim with specific examples as either of these European powers would have at the time.
4. How did Popé’so revolt in 1680 immediately restore freedom to the Pueblo Indians, and what happened once the Spanish returned?
5. Both at home and in the New World, the Dutch enjoyed greater freedoms than other European citizens. Explore this comparison using specific examples.
