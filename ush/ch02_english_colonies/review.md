# Review Questions

REVIEW QUESTIONS
1. Compare and contrast England’s settlement history in the Americas to Spain’s.
Consider the treatment of Indians, the role of the Church, the significance of women,
and economic development.

* English colonization was very different from Spanish colonization. For
  example, where the Spanish virtually enslaved the Native Americans in the
  encomienda system, the English weren't nearly as brutal. While the English
  massacred many Indians, for example, in the Pequot war, and then took over
  many of their villages, like placing Plymouth on the remains of Paw text,
  they didn't force the Native Americans to engage in labor. The Spanish
  conquest was almost entirely organized by the church, with the leaders being
  fathers of the church and the conquerors building missions to spread
  Christianity throughout. While English colonization was also heavily focussed
  on religion -- they were Puritans after all, religion was a crucial part of
  their society -- the English didn't care nearly as much as converting the
  Indians to Christianity. With regards to women, the Spanish conquerors really
  didn't bring any women with them, which led to many relationships with Native
  American women, whose descendants are now known as mestizos, while the
  English did bring their families with them, building actual colonies.
  Finally, the Spanish economic development was focussed on using Native and
  African labor to exploit the natural resources, English economic development
  was focussed on just making the colony survive.

2. For the English, land was the basis of liberty. Explain the reasoning behind that
concept and how it was markedly different from the Indians’ conception of land.

* The English concept of land being the basis of liberty inherits from the
  liberal ideas of John Locke, with property being an inalienable right. This
  idea came from the Manga Carta, which itself was written by propertied nobles
  annoyed at the King for what they say as his tyranny. The English imagined
  that anyone could use the land they owned, farm it, and work themselves
  upward. In contrast to that, Native Americans saw land as something which was
  the common property of all people, and while the tribal leader to grant a
  certain plot of land to a specific family for a particular use, they could
  not own it. 

3. Many Puritans claimed they came to North America seeking religious freedom,
but they were extremely intolerant of other beliefs. In fact, there was greater liberty
of conscience back in their native England. How do you explain this?

* By religious freedom, the Puritans meant religious freedom for themselves --
  particularly, their own brand of Calvinism which not only believed in
  predestination but also reorganized society completely around lines of
  demonstrating piety and religious adherence. During this time, England was
  going through a tumultuous Civil War, and a Henry VIII's Reign of Terror had
  sought to impose Anglicanism on the entire country, which the Puritans
  refused to accept. So they fled to America where they were free to setup
  their own theocratic ethnostate.

4. Describe who chose to emigrate to North America from England in the seventeenth
century and explain their reasons.

* Several different groups immigrated to North America from England. Jamestown
  was founded by a royal charter and became a somewhat prosperous tobacco
  colony. Plymouth was founded by Puritan Separatists who felt they were
  persecuted by the Anglican majority and the King back in England, and the
  Massachusetts Bay Colony, which later became Boston, was founded by more
  moderate Puritans who gained a royal charter to build their own colony. An
  additional 15k settlers fled to the Massachusetts Bay Colony following the
  English Civil War in an event known as the Great Migration.

5. In what ways did the New England economy and government differ from those in
the Chesapeake colonies?

* See [SAQ Chesapeake v. New England](./saq_cheasapeake_new_england.md)
* The Chesapeake colonies were focussed on using tobacco as a cash crop, and
  they built their entire economy around that specific goal. In contrast to
  that, the New England economy was more diversified, featuring lumber,
  fishing, whaling, and trading. This is reflected in their governmental system
  as well. Both Maryland and Virginia relied on slavery as part of their
  plantation system, while the New England colonies opposed slavery. Maryland
  was a proprietary colony, run by Lord Baltimore, while Virginia was a
  corporate colony (which later became a royal colony under direct oversight of
  the King), and had a house of Burgesses which allowed wealthy landowners to
  vote. In contrast to that, the government in some of the New England
  colonies, like Massachusetts and New Hampshire, was almost entirely based on
  the puritan religion (though there were exceptions here too, for example,
  Rhode Island was very deliberately built as a secular colony by Anne
  Hutchinson and Roger Williams).

6. The English believed that, unlike the Spanish, their motives for colonization were
pure, and that the growth of empire and freedom would always go hand-in-hand. How
did the expansion of the British empire affect the freedoms of Native Americans, the
Irish, and even many English citizens?

* The expansion of the British empire significantly hurt the freedoms of Native Americans. The English had colonized Ireland shortly before coming to America, burning villages and forcing the Irish onto reservations, and treated the Native Americans much the same as the Irish. For example, in Jamestown, after the Powhatans rescued Jamestown from a disastrous winter by sharing their food, the British steadily encroached on their land. The caricatured the natives as savage, beast-like,and cannibalistic, and then used various techniques -- like breaking treaties, destroying crops and shelter, poisoning the Indians during a feast -- to completely take over their land (see [A Different MIrror](./different_mirror_excerpt.md)). The treatment of the Native Americans in New England was similar. Numerous Indians died of smallpox, in response, the British took over their villages. In the Pequot War, the British massacred 700 Pequots, and justified this arguing the Indians were lazy, wild, devil-worshippers who were unable to own land. 

7. Considering politics, social tensions, and debates over the meaning of liberty, how
do the events and aftermath of the English Civil War demonstrate that the English
colonies in North America were part of a larger Atlantic community?

8. How did the tobacco economy draw the Chesapeake colonies into the greater
Atlantic world?

## FREEDOM QUESTIONS
1. With many degrees of freedom coexisting in seventeenth-century North America,
a person might go from having no rights to possessing many in a lifetime. Use exam-
ples to demonstrate this fact.
2. To provide full freedoms for the higher social orders in both England and English
North America, lower social orders had to do without. Explain how and why this was so.
3. How did the concepts and goals of “freedom” differ for the following settlers:
newcomers to John Smith’s Jamestown; a Puritan family in 1630s Massachusetts;
and a Catholic landowner in 1640s Maryland?
4. Explain how the Puritans used their concept of moral liberty to justify their actions
against others in the New World. Then discuss why some Puritans, other English set-
tlers in the New World, and those remaining in England might see these justifications
as hypocritical.
5. Review the debates over the true meaning of freedom and “English liberty” follow-
ing the English Civil War. What would you say was the lasting significance of these
debates?
