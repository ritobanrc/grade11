## 3-2-1 Analysis

### 3 things learned
* The English treatment of Indians in America was foreshadowed by and heavily inspired from the English conquest of Ireland. Queen Elizabeth I believed that Ireland posed political threat to England, being Catholic and possibly allying with France or Spain, and encouraged its colonization. And much like the Indians, the Irish were viewed as less than the English, "lack[ing] 'knowledge of God or good manners.'", did not own property, did not "improve their lands" or "live together in setled [sic] Villages or Townes", "'naturally' given to 'idleness'". Altogether, this stereotyping created created a distinct class divide between the English and the Irish, and went on to be codified into law. The Irish were forbidden from "wear[ing] English apparel", "purchase land, bare office, be chosen of any jury, or admitted witness", or intermarry with the English. The English sought to impose their colonization with violence, to "teach duty and obedience", burning villages, murdering families, and prominently displaying the heads of those they killed. These tendencies, as they applied to the Irish, can almost be thought of as a practice round for the English, as it heavily influence what happened to the Indians. Many of the early colonizers had also participated in the invasion of Ireland, including "Sir Humphrey Gilbert, Lord De La Warr, Sir Francis Drake, and Sir Walter Raleigh", and the two ideas, colonization of the New World and colonization of Ireland can often be seen discussed in tandem in correspondences of people at the time. Right from the beginning, the English started to draw comparisons between the Irish and the Indians, comparing deerskin robes to Irish mantels, their fighting styles, where the forests of New England were "like the bogs to the wild Irish", 

* Many people, including Thomas Jefferson, believed that the settlers and Indians could be friends and cooperate. However, in practice, they meant that the Indians would give up their way of life and adopt the European lifestyle. Despite declaring that colonists and Indians would "long continue to smoke in friendship together", he was also making plans to exterminate them, commit genocide against them " I would never cease pursuing them while one of them remained on this side [of] the Mississippi. We would never cease pursuing them with war while one remained on the face of the earth." The few places where Jefferson accepted the presence of Indians, he believed they needed to be civilized, entirely giving up their way of life to become westernized farmers, because he believed the white culture was fundamentally superior, "When the white people first came to this land, they were few, and you were many; now we are many, and you few; and why?". In essence, Jefferson blamed the Indians for their own decline. One particularly egregious quote included in the text demonstrates really clearly that Jefferson found the Indians to be lesser, less developed than the colonists, and that explains his behavior perfectly.

> "Let a philosophic observer commence a journey from the savages of the Rocky Mountains, eastwardly towards our sea-coast. There he would observe in the earliest stage of association living under no law but that of nature, subsisting and covering themselves with flesh and skins of wild beasts. He would next find those on our frontiers in the pastoral state, raising domestic animals to supply the defects of hunting. Then succeed our own semi-barbarous citizens, the pioneers of the advance of civilization, and so in progress he would meet the gradual shades of improving man until he would reach his, as yet, most improved state in our seaport towns. This, in fact, is equivalent to a survey, in time, of the progress of man from infancy to the present day.""


* Indians were often, often literally with the devil, so the concept of Puritanism became defined by excluding the Indians. The New World was seen as a Garden of Eden, "air as 'most sweet' and as 'virgin and temperate,' and its soil 'lusty' with meadows 'full of green grass.'" In contrast to the innocent portrayal of the land, the natives often kidnapped and exhibited by the Europeans "personified 'savagery'", "thought to be cannibals", "delight to torment men in the most bloody manner", having "eyes in their shoulders, and their mouths in the middle of their breasts." Altogether, the Indians were subhuman, animalistic. Additionally, they were significantly less chaste than the Europeans, Vespucci reported that "They...are libidinous beyond measure, and the women far more than the men....When they had the opportunity of copulating with Christians, urged by excessive lust, they defiled and prostituted themselves". Altogether, the Indians came to be associated with the devil, while the Europeans were seen as holy. This view was reinforced when the Indians died as a result of smallpox given to them by the Europeans, "God was 'making room' for the settlers and 'hath hereby cleared our title to this place.'", and as such, the colonists often built their colonies on top of the decimated ruins of Indian villages -- Plymouth was build on top of the Wampanoag village of Pawtuxet. But not only were the Indians seen as subhuman, but the Puritans began to define themselves as "not Indian". The Rev. Cotton Mather wrote, "We have too far degenerated into Indian vices. The vices of the Indians are these: They are very lying wretches, and they are very lazy wretches; and they are out of measure indulgent unto their children; there is no family government among them. We have [become] shamefully Indianized in all those abominable things". The Puritans believed they had civilized the land, replacing "'hideous thickets' for wolves and bears" with "streets 'full of Girls and Boys sporting up and down'", replacing "'wigwams'" with "orderly, fair, and well built houses". Takaki summarizes it as "Indians came to personify the Devil and everything the Puritans feared—the body, sexuality, laziness, sin, and the loss of self-control."

### 2 connections
* Takaki describes how Shakespeare's play _The Tempest_ represented the European view of the native Americans during the early colonization. Takaki first discusses the archetype of the "wild Irish", whom at first, Caliban fits into. The play calls Caliban "a devil" from a "vile race" with dark complexion.To many in the audience, Caliban might have resembled the Irish." However, the "reference to the “Bermoothes” [Bermuda]" makes it abundantly clear Caliban was from the New World. Takaki details the comparisons between Caliban's island and Virginia, "The air breathes upon us here most sweetly", "How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!". Takaki compares the name Caliban with the tribe its derived from, "Carib" and the derivative term cannibal, a common tendency of Shakespeare. In response to having his land taken over, Caliban responds, "As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island." The analogy to the treatment of Indians is clear. Much the same way that Jefferson believed Indians needed to be civilized, Caliban could too be "civilized through 'nurture,' or education". Much the same as the Indians were forced off their land as the English sought to conquer everything, not content with what they had, Prospero told Caliban, "Here you sty, me in this hard rock" while lamenting "you do keep from me the rest o’ the island". The metaphor that Takaki draws illustrates how the Indians were portrayed by the Europeans, and how London theatergoers were aware of and content with the treatment of the Indians. As Jefferson intended to "drive [the Indians], with the beasts of the forests into the Stony mountains", Prospero segregated Caliban, illustrating the European's perceived victory of "cerebral over carnal".

* Right from the beginning, the Europeans viewed themselves as holy and superior and actively sought to commit genocide against the Indians. At first, the interests of the colonists were primarily economic, "increase in the population of their homeland from three to four million, the problems of famine, and the rise of the wool industry with its accompanying evictions of farmers." combined with "resources—timber, furs, fish, and especially land". It's no surprise that the colonists reacted as though America was a Garden of Eden--compared to England, it was a cornucopia of opportunity. It's unsurprising that the English went on to commit genocide against the Indians, the snakes in their Garden of Eden. Takaki describes how "seven hundred Pequots were killed by the English and their Indian allies", and the brutal tactics used by the English, "burn[ing] ... both men, women, and children.", leaving less than 5 to escape. The English viewed this as "great and doleful". Similarly, during King Phillip's War, Takaki describes how "six thousand Indians died from combat and disease, and thousands more were shipped out of New England as slaves". Though these topics are also discussed in the AMSCO book, Takaki places more emphasis on the European rationalization for such actions, citing the Rev. Cotton Mather, "Devil decoyed those miserable savages [to New England] in hopes that the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ would never come here to destroy or disturb His absolute empire over them". 


### 1 critique
* Finally, Takaki does a particularly good job walking a fine line between actually portraying the horror of what was done to the Indians, while also avoiding accidentally falling into the "noble savage" stereotype. For example, when discussing King Phillip's War, Takaki is meticulous and addresses the impact of Indian aggression in the first place "twenty-five English towns, more than half of all the colonists’ settlements in New England, had been ruined and the line of English habitation had been pushed back almost to the coast". However, he does a good job still defending his point by looking at the rationalizations the English had for their action, from the Rev. Increase Mather, "so Devil-driven as to begin an unjust and bloody war upon the English, which issued in their speedy and utter extirpation from the face of God’s earth". Similarly, by highlighting how the English viewed the Indians as similar to the Irish, Takaki effectively establishes that that the Indians were not a unique brand of "noble savage" -- instead, that being in a position of power, the English were able to subjugate others and did so effectively on more than one occasion.
