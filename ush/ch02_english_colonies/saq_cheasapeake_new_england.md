# SAQ - Cheasapeake v New England

1.  ONE similarity between British colonies in Chesapeake region and British colonies in New England region.

    a. One important similarity between the Chesapeake colonies and the New England colonies was the level of religious intolerance and conformity. New England had a very strong Puritan identity, where non-Christians were ostracized, not allowed political representation, and often exiled. Similarly, early Maryland was intended to be a bastion of Catholic refugees from England, and a very strong social hierarchy placing Catholic gentleman about Protestant servants was developed. In both of these places, both non-Christians and Christians of the "wrong" denomination were severely discriminated against, initially did not have political rights, and were generally subjected to worse conditions than those of the "right" Christian denomination.

2.  ONE difference between British colonies in Chesapeake region and British colonies in New England region.
    
    a. One important difference between the two colonies was the structure of their economy. Virginia, a Chesapeake colony largely relied on slave labor to farm cash crops like tobacco and cotton, and Maryland was similar. On the other hand, the New England colonies had a very strong Puritan work ethic, leading to an industry centered around some farming, but also fishing, timber, and trade. This distinction between slave labor and the Protestant work ethic is really important as slavery eventually becomes a very big point of contention in US history.  

3.  ONE factor that accounts for the difference in (b)

    a. One important factor that accounts for the difference in economic structure between the Chesapeake and New England colonies is the origin of their colonies. Virginia and Maryland were company and proprietary colonies respectively, and thus, had very clear profit motives and motivations for investing in slavery. On the other hand, the Pilgrims which came to New England viewed hard work as participation in the community and evidence of salvation. The demographics, nature, and motivation of the people who initially came to each of these colonies is an important factor leading to the difference in economic structure.
