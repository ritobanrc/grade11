# Ch 2. The Thirteen Colonies and the British Empire

## Types of Colonies
* 3 types of **Charters** (document grating privilege and land rights)
    - _Corporate_: Operated by a joint stock company, owned by people who come together to own stock (eg. early Jamestown)
    - _Royal_: directly under authority of king (e.g. Virginia after 1624)
        - Virginia goes from Corporate to Royal -- the King removed the Corporate charter and took it over
    - _Proprietary_: Under authority of individuals granted charter of ownership by king
        - Maryland (Lord Baltimore)
        - Pennsylvania (William Penn)
        - One person creates and owns the colony, but on behalf of a king



### English Colonies
* English idea of **representative government**
    - Everyone is assumed to have some rights incl. The right to representation.

## The Chesapeake Colonies
* 1632 -- Virginia split into Maryland

### Maryland
* Proprietary -- given to George Calvert (Lord Baltimore)
    - Reward for supporting Catholicism (and King Charles I) in civil war
* Intended to grow wealth and power
* Cecil Calvert becomes Lord Baltimore
* **Act of Toleration**: 
    - Initially, Maryland is wealthy Catholics
    - Then Protestant servants and farmers immigrate
    - Act of Toleration allows **both Protestants and Catholics to practice**
    - But **non-Christians executed**
* **Protestant Revolt**
    - Revolt, Civil War → Act of Toleration repealed
    - Catholics lose right to vote

### Virginia
* Bicameral legislature
    - House of Burgesses (representative of burghers, landowners)
* **Economic problems**
    - High supply of tobacco → Low prices
    - Govt. Price fixing → London merchants retaliate
* **Political problems and Bacon's Rebellion**
    - _Sir William Berkeley_: **Royal** governor of Virginia, prioritizes of large plantations
        - Uses govt. power to support plantations
    - _Nathanial Bacon_ + Small farmers revolt
        - Massacred Indians on frontier 
        - Burned Jamestown
        - Revolt collapsed after Bacon dies of dysentery
        - Accused of revolting against Royal authority
* **Lasting problems**
    - Sharp class differences (placation owners vs farmers -- also the slaves but AMSCO doesn't mention that)
    - Colonial resistance to royal control

### Labor Shortages

Causes | Results
-------|----------
Poor climate          |  Slavery                    
High death rate       |  Indentured servitude          
    Disease           |  Headright system

* **Indentured Servitude**
    - Rich person pays for passage
    - Work w/o pay for X years (for room and board)
    - Freed at the end
* **Headright system**: Virginia govt. gives 50 acres land to people who pay for passage
    - If a plantation owner paid for your passage, they get the money
* **Slavery**:
    - First in 1619
    - Initially, colonists could not afford slaves
        - Slaves treated similar to indentured servants
    - House of Burgesses passes law that children of _Black_ slaves were also slaves

* _mercantilism_: accumulate wealth to increase military and political strength of country
* **Acts of Trade and Navigation**
    - Trade w/ colonies carried by English ships w/ English crews
    - All trade w/ colonies must pass through England
    - Enumerated goods like tobacco could only be exported to England
* **Positive Effects**
    - Shipbuilding prospered, 
    - Chesapeake Tobacco monopoly in England
    - English military protected colonies -- QUESTION: why is this under Impacts of Acts of trade and navication??
* **Negative Effects**
    - Manufacturing limited
    - Chesapeake farmers receive low prices -- QUESTION: How?
    - Colonists pay high prices for goods from England
* Unnecessary -- England was main trading partner for colonies anyway 
    - Negative > Positive

### The Institution of Slavery
* Grew rapidly
    * 1/2 of Virginia's pop, 2/3 of SC's
* **Causes for Increased Demand**
    - Increased wages in England → **fewer immigrants to colonies**
    - **Reliability** -- large plantation owners didn't trust small farmers after Bacon's rebellion
    - Tobacco prices fall, **Rice and indigo become more common**, need more labor
* **Slave Laws**
    - 1641, Mass. Recognize slavery as "lawful"
    - 1661, Virginia, Children inherit mother's slave status
    - 1664, Maryland, Baptism doesn't affect slave status
