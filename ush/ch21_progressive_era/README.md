> Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. DuBois represent two different approaches to the struggle and oppression of African Americans. Washington argues that Black people must work their way up from the bottom, that they should "cast down their bucket where they are" and seek to participate in the Southern way of life, with African Americans as domestic servants or field laborers. He says that by doing that, Black people can slowly work their way up from the bottom. In contrast. W.E.B. DuBois accuses Washington of virtually accepting that Black people are inferior. Instead, DuBois argues that political equality is a crucial prerequisite to economic equality, and points to the legal disenfranchisement of Black people (separate but equal, sharecropping, Black codes, the underfunding of Black schools and communities) as evidence for the fact that without political control, it's impossible for Black people to educate themselves or work to improve their condition.
