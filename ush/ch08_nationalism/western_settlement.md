## Western Settlement and Missouri Compromise
* Population west of Appalachia doubled
* Nationalism centered around the west

### Reasons for Westward movement
* **Stealing Indian Territory** 
    - William Henry Harrison and Andrew Jackson
* **Economic Pressures**
    - Embargo +  War → people look for new future → Appalachia
    - Tobacco planters need new land (soil exhausted by poor farming methods)
* **Improved transportation**
    - More roads, canals, stemaboats, railroads built
* **Imigrants**
    - Speculators offer cheap land in Great Lakes, Ohio, Cumberland, Mississippi River Valley

### New Questions and Issues
* Western states have small populations
    - Political bargaining necessary
    - Politcs:
        * Easy credit "cheap money" from state banks (rather than federal)
        * Land sold at low prices by government
        * improved transportaiton
* Slavery (undecided)
    - Southern states want it (cotton fields)
    - Northern states don't want it
    - Missouri Territory applies for statehood → controversy

### Missouri Compromise
* 1791-2, Vermont is free, Kentucky is slave
    - (Senate is) Perfectly Balanced, as all things should be!
    - But northern states have larger population (House isn't balanced)
* Missouri was a slave state, could tip the senate!
* **Tallmadge Amendment** (from NY)
    - Prohibit new slaves into Missouri
    - Requires slave children to be freed at 25
    - (i.e. gradual elimination)
    - Defeated in the senate
* **Clay's propoals**
    - Missouri admitted as slave state
    - Maine admitted as free state
    - Slavery prohibited north of latitude 36° 30'
    - Passed by congress, signed by Monroe
* **Aftermath**
    - Maintained for 30 years
    - Nationalism and Sectionalism in tension
